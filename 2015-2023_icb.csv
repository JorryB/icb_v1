2018-2019,Critical Illness,Application of policy terms,保單條款的詮釋,1,Definition of Cardiomyopathy,「心肌病」的定義,Coronary angiography/ intra-aortic balloon pump insertion/ continuous invasive mechanical ventilation/ implantation of automatic cardiac defibrillator/ ventricular fibrillation/ cardiogenic shock/ cardiac arrest/ not cardiomyopathy/ poor left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF: 30%-45%)/ heart failure symptoms / New York Heart Association (NYHA)/ heart failure symptoms Class IV/ permanent damage to her heart muscle,冠狀動脈造影檢查 主動脈內球囊反搏 持續侵入性呼吸器協助呼吸 自動心臟除顫器植入手術 心室顫動 心源性休克 心臟驟停 不屬於心肌病 左心室收縮功能 欠佳(左心室射出率為30%-45%) 心臟衰竭症 《紐約 心臟協會》第四級的受損程度 心臟肌肉因心臟疾 病導致永久受損,"The insured was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of a government hospital following a fainting on street. Coronary angiography, intra-aortic balloon pump insertion, continuous invasive mechanical ventilation, etc. were performed during the confinement. She received implantation of automatic cardiac defibrillator in another government hospital one week later. The final diagnoses were ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. The insured then submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for ""cardiomyopathy"". Since no diagnosis of cardiomyopathy was made or mentioned in either the claim form or the discharge slips from the two hospitals, the insurer declined the claim on the grounds that her condition was not cardiomyopathy. The insured later submitted a reference letter from her attending doctor who confirmed that the insured was presented with ventricular fibrillation with poor left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF: 30%-45%), New York Heart Association (NYHA) heart failure symptoms Class IV and there was permanent damage to her heart muscle as a result of the cardiac condition. However, given that there was no permanent and irreversible physical impairment, the insurer maintained its view to decline the insured's critical illness claim.","受保人在街上暈倒後被送往公立醫院急症室,住院期間進行 了冠狀動脈造影檢查、主動脈內球囊反搏、持續侵入性呼吸 器協助呼吸等,一星期後,受保人於另一家公立醫院接受自 動心臟除顫器植入手術,最終的診斷結果為心室顫動、心源 性休克及心臟驟停。受保人其後向保險公司提出「心肌病」 的危疾索償申請。由於索償表格及兩家公立醫院發出的出院摘要均沒有提及心 肌病的診斷結果,保險公司遂以受保人的病況不屬於心肌病 為理由,拒絕作出賠償。受保人其後向保險公司提交主診醫 生發出的信函,確定受保人出現心室顫動及左心室收縮功能 欠佳(左心室射出率為30%-45%),心臟衰竭症狀達《紐約 心臟協會》界定為第四級的受損程度,而心臟肌肉因心臟疾 病導致永久受損。然而,由於沒有證據顯示受保人有永久及 不可復原的身體受損,保險公司遂維持拒絕賠償的決定。","It is stipulated in the provisions of the critical illness policy that ""cardiomyopathy"" means ""impaired ventricular function of variable aetiology, resulting in permanent and irreversible physical impairments to the degree of at least Class 4 of the New York Heart Association Classification of Cardiac Impairment. The diagnosis must be confirmed by a cardiologist and supported by the appropriate test results including echocardiography ... "" Having reviewed all the available information, the Complaints Panel noted that the insured's degree of cardiac impairment had fulfilled Class IV of the NYHA classification as stipulated in the definition. As for the term ""permanent and irreversible physical impairments"", the Complaints Panel believed that it should be interpreted in a broader sense as ""limitation on a person's physical functioning, mobility, dexterity or stamina"" rather than simply ""physical incapacity to move"". Given that the insured did suffer from permanent damage to her heart muscle and had implanted with an automatic cardiac defibrillator, the Complaints Panel was convinced that her condition fulfilled the policy definition of ""cardiomyopathy"".","有關危疾保單訂明:「心肌病」是指 「由任何病因引起心室功能損傷,導 致受保人身體永久和不可逆轉地受損 最少達《紐約心臟協會》界定的第四 級心臟受損程度。診斷必須由心臟科 醫生證實,並需提供包括超聲心電圖 在內的適當測試報告予以支持…」。投訴委員會審閱所有文件後,得悉受 保人的心臟受損程度已達保單內訂明 的《紐約心臟協會》界定的第四級受 損程度。至於「心肌病」定義內「永 久及不可逆轉的身體受損」的要求, 投訴委員會認為應該廣義地詮釋為 「一個人的身體功能、活動能力、靈 活性或耐力的限制」,而非僅簡單地 指「身體殘障以致無法活動」。基於 受保人已被確診患上永久性心臟肌肉 受損,並需植入自動心臟除顫器,投 訴委員會相信她的病況符合保單內 「心肌病」的定義。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insured and resolved that the insurer should settle the critical illness claim for HK$468,000.","投訴委員會裁定受保人得直,保險公司需向她發放46.8萬港元的危疾賠償。","Critical illness contracts cover specific serious illnesses which are listed and defined in the policy. The contract terms contain specific descriptions of the medical conditions of the critical illnesses and may state that the diagnosis should be made by particular medical specialists or specific tests should be prescribed to confirm the diagnosis. If there is concrete evidence proving that the claimant fulfills all the medical conditions and criteria as stipulated in the critical illness definition, the Complaints Panel will usually rule in his/her favour.","危疾保險為保單列明的指定嚴重疾病 提供保障,保單條款清楚訂明診斷有 關嚴重疾病的具體醫學標準,甚至會 註明該等診斷必須由相關的專科醫生 或透過特定測試來確診。倘若有具體 證據證明受保人的病況符合保單內有 關危疾定義訂明的所有情況及條件, 投訴委員會一般會裁定受保人得直。"

About 15 months later, she was admitted to a private hospital in Fujian for excision of right thyroid adenocarcinoma. During claims investigation, the insurer learnt from the medical records issued by a hospital in Xiamen that the insured was diagnosed with thalassemia/alpha thalassemia about a year prior to the policy application. She had abnormal blood test results, including elevated uric acid, elevated triglycerides, elevated total cholesterol, etc. Since the aforesaid medical information was not disclosed in the policy application form, the insurer declined the critical illness claim on the grounds of material non-disclosure.","受保人在投保申請書上申報健康病歷,保險公司以標準條款繕 發危疾保單。約15個月後,她入住福建一間私家醫院進行右 甲狀腺癌切除手術。於調查索償期間,保險公司從廈門一間醫院的醫療紀錄得悉, 受保人在投保約一年前被診斷患有地中海貧血/甲型地中海貧 血,並有不正常的血液檢驗結果,包括:高尿酸、高甘油三 酯、高總膽固醇等。由於受保人沒有在投保申請書上披露相關 病歷資料,保險公司遂以她沒有披露重要事實為理由,拒絕其 危疾索償。","According to the insured, she was inherited with thalassemia since birth. As her thalassemia was only of a minor type, she had not been treated for it. As regards the blood tests done in Xiamen hospital, they were all arranged during her labour period with no further treatment required.
The Complaints Panel studied the insurer's underwriting manual and learnt that the insured's hemoglobin levels would not account for any premium loading to her critical illness coverage. It also believed that the abnormal findings during the insured's pre-natal checking was a single incident and was not related to any manifested sign or symptom. In this regard, the Complaints Panel was not convinced that the non- disclosed medical information of the insured would have affected the underwriting decision of the insurer.","受保人表示,她自出生便遺傳了地中 海貧血,但只屬輕度型,從來沒有接 受任何治療;而她於廈門醫院進行的 血液測試乃因她懷孕而安排,毋須進 一步跟進治療。投訴委員會研究保險公司的核保手冊 並得悉,以受保人當時的血紅蛋白水 平,其危疾保障的申請應不用徵收附 加保費;投訴委員會又認為,受保人 懷孕時的不正常體檢結果僅屬單一事 件,且與任何呈現的徵狀或病徵無 關。在此情況下,投訴委員會並不認 為受保人沒有披露的資料會影響保險 公司的承保決定。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insured and awarded her the critical illness claim for HK$700,000.","投訴委員會裁定受保人得直,保險公 司需賠付她700,000港元的危疾保障。","The Complaints Panel reminded consumers that the information given by an applicant on the application form has significant impact on the insurer's underwriting assessment. From the information given on the application form, the insurer can identify high-risk features and decide whether or not to take the risk and at what premium and terms. The decision as to whether a piece of medical information is important in underwriting lies with the insurer, not the applicant. One should always bear in mind that non-disclosure could result in policy repudiation and claim rejection. In order to avoid unnecessary claims disputes, an applicant should disclose all material information fully and accurately when filling in the application form.","投訴委員會提醒消費者,投保人在投 保申請書上提供的資料,對保險公司 的核保評估影響重大;保險公司會根 據投保申請書上的資料,判斷是否有 高風險的特徵,從而決定應否承保有 關風險、釐定保費水平和保險合約條 款。病歷資料對核保是否重要,應該 由保險公司而非投保人決定。投保人 應緊記,沒有披露事實會導致保單遭 撤銷或索償被拒,為免引起不必要的 索償糾紛,投保人在填寫投保申請書 時,必須如實披露所有資料。"

Despite medications, physiotherapy and acupuncture treatments, the pain persisted and became more severe. She then consulted a rheumatologist and was advised to seek treatment at a private hospital for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of knee and injection of Hyaluronic acid (HA). The final diagnosis was right knee sprain injury with meniscal tear. The insured subsequently filed a hospitalization claim to the insurer for the hospital expenses incurred during the aforesaid confinement.The insurer reimbursed the insured all the hospital expenses incurred except for those relating to HA injection. This was because there was a lack of clinical evidence proving the efficacy of HA injection in the treatment of knee injury. The insurer considered that HA injection for knee injury was not medically necessary.","一位70歲的受保人患有右膝疼痛持續五個多月,即使接受了 藥物治療、物理治療及針灸,膝痛依然持續並惡化。受保人 於是向風濕科專科醫生求診,並獲建議入住私家醫院接受膝 部磁力共振檢查及透明質酸注射,最終診斷結果為右膝扭傷 及半月板撕裂。受保人隨後就上述住院引致的醫療費用向保 險公司提出住院索償申請。由於缺乏臨床證據證明注射透明質酸對膝損傷具治療功效, 保險公司認為相關透明質酸注射並非醫療必須的治療,因此 僅向受保人賠付除透明質酸注射費用以外的所有其他住院費 用。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions of the hospitalization policy that "" ... the insurer shall not be liable to pay expenses incurred directly or indirectly in connection with and/or for, or in relation to the treatment, medical service, medication or investigation which is not medically necessary"" while ""medically necessary"" means ""the necessity to have a medical service which is ... (e) furnished at the most appropriate level which can be safely and effectively provided to the insured ... "" The Complaints Panel learnt from the insured's attending physician that the insured had MRI performed showing extensive lateral meniscus tear and tear in body and posterior horn of the medial meniscus. She failed conservative treatment for her knee injury and refused surgical intervention due to her old age. She was then advised to have intra articular HA injection to her right knee in order to prevent further damage and to improve mobility. Prospective studies had also demonstrated the benefit of intra articular HA injection in some patients with acute knee damage. In this regard, the Complaints Panel tended to believe that HA injection for treating the insured's knee pain was medically necessary.","有關住院保單的條款訂明:「…保險 公司將不會負責因不是醫療必須的治 療、醫療服務、藥物或檢驗而直接或 間接引致的費用」;而「醫療必須」 乃指「醫療上必須的醫療服務,並 須…(v)以最合適的程度向受保人提供 安全及有效的治療…」。投訴委員會從受保人的主診醫生得 悉,磁力共振檢查確定受保人的外側 半月板有大幅度撕裂,而內側半月板 體部及後角亦有撕裂。受保人曾接受 傳統治療,惟成效不大,又因年紀大 而拒絕接受手術治療,主診醫生於是 建議她接受右膝關節透明質酸注射, 以預防進一步惡化及改善活動能力, 醫學研究亦顯示部分患有急性膝損傷 的病者於關節注射透明質酸具療效作 用。經考慮所有因素後,投訴委員會 同意受保人注射透明質酸以治療膝痛 屬醫療必須的治療。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insured and resolved that the insurer should settle the insured's hospital expenses relating to HA injection. The extra settlement amounted to HK$4,800.","投訴委員會裁定受保人得直,保險公 司需向她賠付透明質酸的注射費用, 涉及額外4,800港元的賠償。","Nearly all hospitalization policies excludes those medical operations or treatments which are experimental or unproven in their efficacy. In handling such kind of disputes, the Complaints Panel would rely very much on whether or not there is sufficient evidence to prove that the procedure is medically justified for treating a particular medical condition.","幾乎所有住院保單均豁免保障試驗性 質或未經證實療效的手術或治療。當 處理涉及醫療必須的糾紛時,投訴委 員會會依重是否有足夠證據支持所進 行的程序在醫學上對治療某特定病況 具療效作用。"

He received gastroscopy, colonoscopy and computed tomography and had a consultation with a cardiologist during confinement. The final diagnoses were gastritis, gastric polyp, colonic polyps and coronary artery disease (CAD). Five days after discharged, the complainant was re-admitted for coronary angiogram and coronary intervention. He then filed two hospitalization claims to the insurer for the hospital expenses incurred. Given that the complainant's second admission for coronary intervention surgery was related to the illness i.e. CAD diagnosed during his first admission and that the two hospitalizations were not separated by more than 90 days, the insurer then treated the two admissions as the same confinement and settled the claim subject to the capped maximum benefit limit.
Despite the complainant's attending doctor confirmed that there was no direct relationship between the two admissions as the first admission was mainly due to gastrointestinal disease while the second one was for CAD, the insurer maintained its view that the two admissions should be treated as the same confinement.","投訴人因上腹痛、排便習慣改變及胸痛入住私家醫院,接受了 胃內窺鏡、結腸鏡及電腦斷層掃描檢查,並於住院期間向心臟 專科醫生求診,最終被診斷患上胃炎、胃瘜肉、腸瘜肉及冠狀 動脈疾病。出院五天後,投訴人再度入院接受冠狀動脈造影及 冠狀動脈介入治療術(俗稱:通波仔),他其後向保險公司就 上述兩次住院的費用提出住院索償申請。基於投訴人第二次住院接受的冠狀動脈介入治療與他第一次住 院被確診患上的冠狀動脈疾病有關,加上兩次住院的時間相距 不足90天,保險公司因此把他兩次住院視作同一次住院處理 索償,並根據保障項目的最高限額作出賠償。雖然投訴人的主診醫生確定投訴人的兩次住院沒有直接關係, 第一次住院的主因為腸胃疾病,而第二次住院則因冠狀動脈疾 病導致,惟保險公司維持原來決定,把該兩次住院視作同一次 住院處理。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions of the hospitalization policy that ""same confinement"" means ""if two or more confinements are due to the same or related injury or illness, or to any complications arising therefrom, such confinements shall be regarded as one confinement if each of them is not separated by more than 90 days from the paid or payable confinement which immediately precedes it. This rule shall be observed in determining the limit of the benefits"". The Complaints Panel noted that the complainant was diagnosed of gastritis and CAD respectively in the first admission. Since gastritis and CAD were two different diagnoses, the Complaints Panel considered that it would be fairer to the complainant if the insurer treated the two diagnosed conditions as two separate disabilities.","有關住院保單的條款訂明:「同一次 住院」是指「因同一次受傷、疾病或 其併發、續發的情況而引致多次住 院,而此等住院相距上一次已賠償或 可賠償的住院不超過90天,則被視為 同一次住院。住院賠償之限額將根據 此條款計算」。投訴委員會得悉,投訴人於第一次住 院分別被診斷患上胃炎和冠狀動脈疾 病,由於胃炎和冠狀動脈疾病屬兩項 不同的診斷,投訴委員會認為保險公 司如把該兩項診斷分開以兩宗傷病處 理,對投訴人應該較為公平。","The Complaints Panel resolved that the insurer should treat the complainant's gastritis in the first admission as one disability and his CAD in the first and second admissions as another disability and settled the claims accordingly subject to separate benefit limit. The extra payment received by the complainant amounted to about HK$26,000.","投訴委員會裁定保險公司應把投訴人 於第一次住院被確診患上的胃炎視作 一宗傷病,而他分別於第一次及第二 次住院接受治療的冠狀動脈疾病視為 另一宗傷病,並按不同保障的限額分 開作出賠償,投訴人因此可獲額外約 26,000港元的賠償。","Nearly all medical insurance policies have ""same disability"" provision to limit its coverage to recurrent confinements due to disability arising from the same cause. In most cases, subsequent treatment arising from the same cause will be considered as the same disability unless they are separated by at least a specified period with no treatment or consultation in between and the insured has fully recovered with no further sign or symptom. The Complaints Panel urges the policyholders to pay special attention to such policy terms and the maximum benefit limits of the policy if they need to be re- admitted for the same medical condition.","幾乎所有住院醫療保單均載有「同一 傷病」條款,為由同一原因導致的傷 病而需重複住院的賠償費用設限。在 大多數的情況下,因相同原因引致的 後續治療會被視為同一傷病,除非兩 次的治療相距至少某個日數,而期間 受保人亦不需要接受任何相關治療或 求診,並且完全康復,沒有任何徵狀 或病徵。委員會敦促保單持有人如因 相同醫療狀況而需再度住院,應特別 留意有關條款及醫療保單內各保障項 目的最高賠償限額。"

She declared in the application form that she had excision of uterine fibroid 24 years ago. The insurer then issued the policy on standard terms. One year after the policy was effected, the insured was admitted to a private hospital for right USG lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection. The final diagnosis was right breast invasive ductal carcinoma with SLN metastasis. The insured later submitted a hospitalization claim to the insurer for the remaining hospital expenses not settled by her group medical policy. During claims investigation, the insurer found that the insured had received hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for six years since 1995. She also had consultations for multiple conditions, including dermatitis, cystitis, sleep disturbance, tension headache, eczema, arthritis, etc. during the period from December 1995 to February 2010. Since the insured failed to disclose the aforesaid medical histories at the time of policy application, the insurer declined her hospitalization claim on the grounds of material non-disclosure.","一位女士於2016年5月申請住院保單,她於投保申請書上申 報了在24年前曾接受子宮瘜肉切除手術,保險公司遂以標準 條款繕發保單。保單生效一年後,受保人入住私家醫院進行 超聲波右乳房腫瘤切除術及前哨淋巴結切除術,最終診斷結 果為右乳腺浸潤性導管癌及前哨淋巴結轉移。受保人隨後就 未獲其團體醫療保單賠償的住院費用向保險公司提出住院索 償申請。
於審核索償期間,保險公司得悉受保人自1995年起接受荷爾 蒙補充療法長達六年,更於1995年12月至2010年2月期間因 不同病況,包括:皮炎、膀胱炎、睡眠障礙、緊張性頭痛、 濕疹、關節炎等求診。由於受保人於投保時沒有申報上述病 歷資料,保險公司遂以她沒有披露重要事實為理由,拒絕其 住院索償。","The Complaints Panel was aware from the information available that the insured had stopped HRT in 2001, which was around 15 years prior to her policy application. As regards her consultations for other medical conditions from 1995 to 2010, the Complaints Panel noted that the consultations were made at least six years before the policy application and the insured usually sought for single episode of illness with no major medical attention required. In the circumstances, the Complaints Panel was inclined to believe that the non- disclosed medical histories of the insured were too remote to be considered as material information which would have affected the underwriting decision of the insurer. More importantly, the Complaints Panel believed that these were not facts which the insured could reasonably be expected to disclose.","投訴委員會從現有資料得悉,受保人 於2001年(即投保約15年前)已停止 接受荷爾蒙補充療法,而她於1995年 至2010年期間因不同病況的應診,亦 已是投保最少六年前的事,受保人的 病況通常是單一出現,毋須特別的醫 療護理。在這情況下,投訴委員會認 為沒有披露的病歷發生時間太遙遠, 不應被視為會影響保險公司承保決定 的重要事實;更重要的是,投訴委員 會認為預期受保人披露有關事實並不 合理。","All in all, the Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insured and awarded her the hospitalization claim of about HK$85,000.","投訴委員會裁定受保人得直,保險公 司需賠償她的住院費用,涉及金額約 85,000港元。","In dealing with non-disclosure disputes, the Complaints Panel focuses mainly on whether or not the non-disclosed fact is:
1. a material fact, which would influence a prudent underwriter in accepting or declining a risk or in fixing the premium or terms and conditions of the contract;
2. a fact within the knowledge of the applicant; and
3. a fact which the applicant could reasonably be expected to disclose.
The Complaints Panel is mindful of whether or not it is fair and reasonable to expect an insured to disclose a particular piece of information alleged by the insurer to be a material fact. If there is no concrete and objective evidence to prove how a single incident of a particular medical condition and/or a treatment occurred long time prior to the policy application would have affected the insurer's underwriting decision, the Complaints Panel believes that it would be unfair and unreasonable for the insurer to base solely on such medical condition to decline a claim for material non-disclosure.","於審議涉及沒有披露事實的糾紛時, 投訴委員會會集中考慮下列各點:
1. 沒有披露的資料是否重要事實,足 以影響審慎的承保商決定應該接受 或拒絕承保,或如何釐定保費和保 單條款及條件;
2. 投保人是否知道有關事實;
3. 在正常情況下,預期投保人披露有 關事實是否合理。
投訴委員會會仔細考慮預期受保人披 露某項被保險公司視為重要事實的資 料,是否對受保人公平和合理。如果 沒有具體及客觀的證據,證明某單一 出現的特定病況及/或在投保一段長 時間前接受的治療會如何影響保險公 司的承保決定,投訴委員會相信保險 公司純粹以受保人沒有披露該病況屬 重要事實,繼而拒絕賠償並不公平和 合理。"

During claims investigation, the insurer found that the insured had attended the Accidental and Emergency Department of a government hospital for epigastric and upper back pain for four days around ten months prior to her policy application. Her blood pressure was 140/83mmHg. Chest, thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine x-rays were done. The diagnoses were chest wall pain and back pain.

The insurer trusts the policyholder to give precise and true details of the subject matter to be insured. This is called the principle of ""Utmost Good Faith"". The nature of the subject matter of insurance and the circumstances pertaining to it are facts within the knowledge of the insured. Insurers, on the other hand, are not aware of these facts unless the insured tells them. The insured, therefore, should always take care to tell the whole truth. Non-disclosure arises when an applicant for an insurance policy fails to disclose in the application form facts within his/her knowledge.
If the non-disclosed fact is a material fact which is within the knowledge of the insured and which the insured could reasonably be expected to disclose, the Complaints Panel will support the insurer's rejection of claim for material non- disclosure even though the non-disclosed information may not be related to the current illness.

The Complaints Panel learnt from the explanations provided by the insured's attending physician that it was well documented among medical literatures that the exact cause of such hip condition was unknown. A very small number of children presented at the time of birth while most patients presented at later stage and even in adulthood. The Complaints Panel believed that the insured's attending doctor should be in a better position to comment on the insured's condition. In addition, the insured was already five years old when he was first diagnosed of bilateral acetabular dysplasia. There was no evidence showing that he had suffered from any gait problem before. Under such circumstances, the Complaints Panel was convinced that the insured's suffering was likely a developmental or acquired condition, rather than a congenital condition.","有關住院保單的「不保事項」條款訂 明:「住院附加契約不承保任何直接 或間接,全部或部分由任何在受保人 17歲生日前已出現徵狀或症狀或已診 斷的先天性疾病」。

Five days after policy issuance, the insured was admitted to a private hospital for right herniotomy under general anaesthesia. He stayed there for two days and the final diagnosis was right inguinal hernia. The day after he was discharged, the insured developed hoarseness of voice and noisy breathing. He was re-admitted for observation and was discharged the next day. The diagnosis was upper airway inflammation. The complainant then lodged two hospitalization claims to the insurer.

The Complaints Panel learnt from various medical literatures that the development of inguinal hernia is the result of the failure of embryonic closure of the internal inguinal ring after the testicle passes through it and it is one of the most common paediatric congenital defects. Given that the insured was diagnosed as suffering from right inguinal hernia at 11 months old and that there was no evidence showing that he had suffered any traumatic or external injury leading to such condition, the Complaints Panel believed that the insured's right inguinal hernia was more likely to be congenital in nature.","有關醫療保單的「不保事項」條款訂 明:「保險公司不會承保由任何於出 生時不論是否已呈現症狀及/或診斷 或已知悉的先天性病況及/或異常… 引起的醫療費用。」
投訴委員會從多個醫療文獻得悉,腹 股溝疝氣乃胎兒發育過程中,腹股溝 內環在睾丸經過後未有關閉而導致, 而腹股溝疝氣是最常見的兒科先天性 缺陷之一。鑑於受保人於11個月大時 被確診患有右腹股溝疝氣,而現時並 沒有客觀證據顯示他曾受創傷或有外 在因素導致右腹股溝疝氣,投訴委員 會因此認為受保人的病況較大機會屬 先天性。

Upon claims investigation, the insurer learnt that the insured had regular consultations for diabetes, hypertension and hyper-cholesterol for four years before the policy application. He was advised to have investigation for suspected occasional ventricular ectopic and heart check-up due to the risk factors of diabetes, hypertension and hyper-cholesterol. Given that the insured's current heart disease was associated with his pre-existing diabetes, hypertension and hyper-cholesterol, the insurer declined the hospitalization claim on the grounds of pre-existing condition exclusion.The insured submitted a letter from his cardiologist who confirmed that the insured had never been diagnosed or treated for coronary disease prior to the policy application.

Although diabetes, hypertension and hyper-cholesterol may be risk factors of coronary artery disease, the Complaints Panel noted that there was no concrete medical evidence to prove that the insured had experienced symptoms of coronary disease or diagnosed of or received medications or treatment for coronary disease during the five years preceding the policy date. Moreover, there was no health declaration required for the policy. The insured was not required to disclose his diabetes, hypertension and hyper-cholesterol in the policy application form.

In this regard, the Complaints Panel resolved to ask the insurer to explain the basis of its claims offer.The insurer later agreed to increase its settlement on the surgeon fee to HK$135,200.

The family arrived Nansha at 6:30pm and boarded the cruise ship before 8:00pm on the same day. According to the itinerary issued by the cruise company, the scheduled arrival time at Nansha Container Terminal was 6:00pm. Given that the family departed Hong Kong for Nansha at 11:00am by shuttle bus arranged by the cruise company and arrived Nansha at 6:30pm, there was no departure delay and only a 30-minute arrival delay.

The couple then decided to purchase tickets from another airline and took the flight which departed Fukuoka to Hong Kong at 8:30pm on the same day. The couple filed a claim for the additional ticket fares incurred under the ""re-routing"" benefit of the travel policy.

Due to the oversight, the insurer agreed in mid December 2017 to settle, on a without prejudice basis, the insured's chiropractic expenses incurred in August and September 2017, and at the same time, informed the complainant that it would not settle any further chiropractic expenses incurred in or after October 2017 if there was no referral letter. The complainant subsequently filed another claim to the insurer for the insured's chiropractic expenses incurred from October to December 2017. Given that the chiropractic expenses was incurred in or after October 2017, the insurer declined her claim. The complainant was not satisfied with the decision and emphasised that she was first informed by the insurer of the need to submit a referral letter in mid December 2017. If she had been notified earlier, she would have arranged her son to obtain a referral prior to seeking chiropractic treatments.","於審核受保人的索償紀錄後,保險公 司發現早前曾在沒有轉介信的情況下 錯誤賠償了受保人接受脊科治療的費 用,基於這個失誤,保險公司於 2017年12月中同意在無損權益下就受 保人2017年8月和9月的脊科費用作出 賠償;同時又通知投訴人,如沒有轉 介信,將不會再賠償2017年10月或之 後的脊科費用。投訴人隨後就受保人2017年10月至 12月的脊科費用再度向保險公司提出 索償申請。鑑於相關脊科費用於 2017年10月或之後發生,保險公司拒 絕賠償。投訴人不滿保險公司的決 定,並強調她是於2017年12月中才首 次獲保險公司通知她需要呈交轉介 信,如果她早獲通知,她會先安排兒 子在取得轉介信後才尋求脊科治療。","The case was referred to three Honorary Secretaries and two of them recommended the insurer to honour the subsequent claim.

The diagnoses were prostatic enlargement and obstruction. He was recommended to have transurethral resection of prostate (TURP). The insured was re-admitted to hospital for TURP procedure around one month later. The final diagnosis was benign prostatic hyperplasia. The insurer reimbursed most of the hospital expenses incurred during the insured’s first confinement. Given that the underlying cause of the insured’s two admissions was inter-related, the insurer treated them as the same disability and settled the insured’s second confinement subject to the capped maximum benefit limits. As such, only about 70% of the total medical expenses incurred by the insured during his second hospitalization was settled.

The Complaints Panel noted from the available information that the reason for the insured’s two confinements was related to his prostatic disorder. The procedure of TURP performed during his second confinement was indeed recommended by the attending physician during his first admission. As the two admissions were not separated by more than 90 days, the Complaints Panel agreed with the insurer to treat them as the same disability.",有關住院保單的條款訂明：「傷病」是指「受傷、不適、疾病或病痛，並包括由同一原因造成的所有傷病及其一切併發症。不過，若受保人完全康復持續 90 天（由最後經註冊醫生治療或出院日起計算，以較後者為準），任何繼發的治療皆作新的傷病計算」。投訴委員會從現有的資料文件得悉，受保人兩次住院的原因均與他的前列腺病況有關，而他也是基於第一次住院時的主診醫生的建議，才再次入院接受經尿道前列腺切除術。由於兩次住院相距不超過 90 天，投訴委員會同意保險公司把受保人的兩次住院視作為同一傷病。,"The Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer’s decision in rejecting to pay a further payment of approximately HK$30,000 was appropriate. Such amount was the extra payment which the insured was entitled to receive if his two hospital confinements were treated separately.","投訴委員會裁定保險公司不予賠償額外約 30,000 港元的決定合理，有關金額乃保險公司若分開處理受保人的兩次住院索償而可獲得的額外賠償。","Nearly all medical insurance policies have “same disability”provision to limit its coverage to recurrent confinement(s) due to disabilities arising from the same cause.

The Complaints Panel learnt from the complainant’s attending physician that not all LGSIL were caused by HPV. As there was no evidence to prove that the complainant’s condition was consequent upon HPV and her confinement was to receive treatment for cervical disorder, but not venereal disease, the Complaints Panel considered that the insurer’s decision to decline the claim based on the policy exclusion on venereal disease was not fair and appropriate.",有關住院保單的「不保事項」條款訂明：「保險公司不承保直接或間接因……性病……而引致或造成的受傷、病痛、不適或疾病，並因此而接受的醫療或其他護理服務」。投訴委員會從投訴人的主診醫生得悉並非所有的低度鱗狀上皮病變都是由人類乳頭狀病毒引起。由於現有資料未能證明投訴人的病況源於人類乳頭狀病毒，而她入院是為治療子宮頸疾病，而非性病，因此投訴委員會認為保險公司以性病屬保單的不保事項為理由，拒絕投訴人住院賠償的決定並不公平和合理。,"The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the complainant and resolved that the insurer should reimburse her the medical expenses incurred, amounting to around HK$40,000.","投訴委員會裁定投訴人得直，保險公司需向她賠付住院費用，涉及金額約 40,000 港元。","Most hospitalization policies contain exclusion clause to exclude loss directly or indirectly resulting from certain conditions.

The attending physician confirmed in the letter that the insured’s previous OGD and colonoscopy showed no evidence of polyp in both upper and lower gastro-intestinal tract. The mentioning of polyps in the referral letter should be a wrong entry.

Since the insured was presented with rectal bleeding during her first consultation, the Complaints Panel considered that it was justified for her to receive colonoscopy investigation.

The final diagnosis was TMJ internal derangement. Given that the hospitalization policy excludes dental treatment, the insurer declined the claim. The insured later referred to the policy exclusion which clearly states the types of dental treatments/oral surgeries which would be covered by the policy and emphasized that her surgery belonged to one of those dental treatments. However, since the insured’s attending physician is a dentist who specialized in OMFS, but not a registered medical practitioner as defined in the policy, the insurer maintained its decision to decline the claim.",受保人在口腔頜面外科專科醫生的安排下入住私家醫院進行雙側顳顎關節穿刺術及注射，最終診斷為顳顎關節內部紊亂，他隨後向保險公司提交住院索償申請。由於有關住院保單並不保障牙科治療，保險公司遂拒絕賠償。受保人其後向保險公司指出保單合約內的「不受保項目」明確地列明了可獲承保的牙科治療／口腔手術的類型，並強調她接受的手術屬於該類牙科治療。然而，由於受保人的主診醫生為牙醫，屬口腔頜面外科專科，不符合保單內「註冊醫生」的定義，保險公司因此維持原來不予賠償的決定。,"It is defined in the hospitalization policy that “Registered Medical Practitioner” means “...those persons duly qualified and legally registered as such to practice Western medicine in HKSAR…”.

(b) oral surgery when properly referred for reduction of a dislocation or fracture of the jaw or facial bone; excision of a benign or malignant neoplasm of the jaw”. Having duly examined the policy wordings and provisions, the Complaints Panel considered that since the aforesaid policy exclusion has clearly listed out the types of dental treatments/oral surgeries which would be covered by the policy, these dental treatments/ oral surgeries should not be bound by the requirement that they should be performed by a registered medical practitioner. Having sought further clarifications from the insured’s attending physician, the Complaints Panel learnt that the insured’s condition was anterior disc displacement with pain and arthritis which was not related to a dislocation or fracture of the jaw. It therefore agreed that the claim fell within the aforesaid policy exclusion. ",有關醫療保單訂明：「註冊醫生」指「……具有正式資格並在香港特別行政區合法註冊為西醫的人士……」；而「不受保項目」的條款訂明：「保險公司不承保任何類別的牙科及口腔手術護理和治療……保單只承保下列與牙科治療有關的服務：……(b) 經適當轉介的口腔手術，以治療頜骨脫位或骨折；切除頜骨良性或惡性腫瘤」。投訴委員會經檢視了保單的用詞及條款後，認為保單內的「不受保項目」條款已清晰列出可獲保障的牙科治療／口腔手術的類型，故這些牙科治療／口腔手術不應再受「只由註冊醫生進行」的限制。應投訴委員會的要求，受保人的主診醫生其後澄清受保人的病況為顳顎關節盤前移，並出現疼痛及關節炎，惟卻與頜骨脫位或骨折無關，投訴委員會因此贊同受保人的索償屬保單的不保事項。,"The Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer’s decision in declining the hospitalization claim of around HK$79,000 was appropriate.","投訴委員會裁定保險公司不予向受保人作出住院賠償的決定合理，涉及的金額約 79,000港元。","All insurance contracts contain an “exclusion” section which lists all the losses, perils, situations, conditions or circumstances that are excluded from the insurance coverage.

The class of benefit was ward level. The complainant’s son (the insured) was later admitted to a private hospital to receive circumcision for his balanitis. The hospital expenses incurred was about HK$21,000. Since the insured was admitted to a semi-private room during his confinement, the insurer applied a room adjustment factor of 50% to the claims settlement. The complainant subsequently submitted to the insurer a letter from the private hospital. It was stated that the insured was admitted to a semi-private room instead of a ward room because all the ward rooms were fully occupied upon his admission. The insured was charged for the semi-private room rate but his hospital services fees such as meals, pathology tests, medical imaging services, medications and nursing services, etc. were charged according to the ward room rate. The insurer then agreed to remove the room adjustment factor for meals, drugs, hospital expenses and the operating theatre fee, and settled an extra HK$2,500 to the complainant. However, the insurer maintained to apply 50% adjustment to room charge, surgeon’s fee, anaesthetist’s fee and doctor’s visit fee. The complainant was not satisfied with the decision and emphasized that surgeon’s fee, anaesthetist’s fee and doctor’s visit fee had been agreed with the attending physician prior to the insured’s admission and these fees had not been raised when the room was upgraded. ","投訴人為家人購買住院保單，病房級別為「大房」。投訴人的兒子（受保人）其後因龜頭炎入住私家醫院接受環切術，住院費用約21,000 港元。由於受保人入住了半私家病房，保險公司因此在處理相關住院賠償時加入了50% 的調整。投訴人隨後向保險公司遞交由醫院發出的信函，指出受保人入院時所有大房已爆滿，所以他被安排入住半私家病房；然而，除了住房費按半私家病房費用收取外，其餘的住院服務，如：膳食、病理檢查、影像掃描服務、藥物及護理服務等均按大房費用收費。保險公司其後同意取消膳食費、藥物費、住院服務費及手術室費的賠償調整，並向投訴人額外賠償 2,500 港元，惟卻堅持需於住房費、外科醫生手術費、麻醉師費及醫生巡房費加入50% 的賠償調整。投訴人不滿有關決定，強調他在受保人入院前已與其主診醫生商議好外科醫生手術費、麻醉師費及醫生巡房費的費用，相關費用並沒有因為病房升級而上調。","According to the “Benefits” provisions of the hospitalization policy, “If an insured person is confined to a higher level of room accommodation than that he/she is entitled to under the policy, the insurer will adjust the amount of benefit payable by multiplying the respective adjustment factor”. The adjustment factor will be 50% if the insured person is entitled to ward class but he/she receives treatment in a semi-private room. Having studied the hospital receipt and other available information, the Complaints Panel considered that there was no information indicating that surgeon’s fee, anaesthetist’s fee and doctor’s visit fee were charged at a higher cost as a result of room upgrading during the insured’s confinement. Given that only room charge was charged at semi-private level, the Complaints Panel was not convinced that the insurer’s application of 50% adjustment factor to surgeon’s fee, anaesthetist’s fee and doctor’s visit fee was fair and reasonable.",有關住院保單的「保障」條款訂明：「如受保人入住的病房級別較保單合約指定的病房級別為高，保險公司在計算賠償時，將按相關病房類別的賠償調整百分比作出賠償」；如受保人合資格入住的病房級別為「大房」，卻入住了半私家病房，相關的賠償調整百分比為 50%。經檢視了醫院收據及其他文件後，投訴委員會認為現有資料沒有顯示外科醫生手術費、麻醉師費及醫生巡房費在受保人入住較高級別病房後有所上調。由於只有住房費是按半私家病房的費用收取，投訴委員會並不贊同保險公司在賠償外科醫生手術費、麻醉師費及醫生巡房費時加入 50% 調整的決定為公平和合理。,"The Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer should re-adjust the claims settlement by taking away the adjustment factor to all charges other than the room rate. The extra amount involved was around HK$9,000.","投訴委員會裁定保險公司需重新計算賠償金額，除住房費用外，不應在其他項目作出賠償調整，重新計算後的賠償金額增加了約9,000 港元。","Most hospitalization policies contain “adjustment factor” clause. If an insured stays in a hospital room class higher than he/she is entitled to under his/her plan, the insurer will reduce the benefits paid by multiplying the room level adjustment factor. However, if it turns out that the hospital does not charge all the expenses at the rate of higher room class in situation where its lower class rooms are fully occupied, the Complaints Panel considers that it may not be fair to the insured if the insurer maintains to apply the adjustment factor to those benefit items which have not been charged at the rate of higher room class in its claims settlement.",大部分醫療保單均載有「賠償調整」的條款。如受保人入住的病房級別高於其保單指定的病房級別，保險公司在賠償時會乘以相關病房升級的調整百分比，以減少應支付之賠償。然而，如果醫院因為較低級別的病房床位額滿而沒有按較高級別的病房收費收取全部的住院費用，投訴委員會認為保險公司如在理賠時向該些沒有按較高級別病房收費的住院項目作出賠償調整，則對受保人不公平。

The insurer reimbursed most of the hospital expenses incurred during her confinement in accordance with policy terms and conditions. The only dispute was the meal/beverage allowance. The insurer noted that the insured is a diabetes patient and was suggested by the attending physician to have diet control. However, she had ordered large amount of high sugar food every day. Since the food ordered was not reasonable and beyond reasonable daily consumption of a normal individual, the insurer deducted the excess meal/beverage allowance (amounting to around 30% of the total meal/beverage expenses) in the claims settlement. ",一位婦人因雙膝骨關節炎、腰椎病、高血壓及糖尿病入住私家醫院七天，其後向保險公司遞交住院索償申請。保險公司按照保單條款及條件支付了大部分的住院費用，唯一爭議涉及膳食／飲料津貼。保險公司知悉受保人乃一名糖尿病患者，而主診醫生亦建議她要控制飲食；然而，她每天卻點選了大量高糖份的食物。由於點選的食物不合理，且超出一位正常人的每天合理食量，保險公司因此於理賠時扣減過量的膳食／飲料津貼，金額約佔總膳食／飲料費用的 30%。,"It is stipulated in the hospitalization policy that “meal/beverage allowance… shall be paid during the time that an insured person is registered and staying as an inpatient in a hospital for treatment of a covered disability and incurs charges thereof. The amount of benefit shall be equal to the normal, proper and actual charges by the hospital during the insured person’s hospital confinement…”. Having duly reviewed the breakdown of the meal/beverage charges, the Complaints Panel noted that the items ordered during the insured’s seven-day hospital confinement included 19 sets of dessert, 18 cans of energy drink, 33 cups of different kinds of drink/soft drink, 12 cups of fruit juice, etc. The Complaints Panel agreed that the food and drinks ordered by the insured during her confinement was excessive and unreasonable even for a person with no symptom of diabetes.",有關住院保單的條款訂明：「受保人登記為住院病人以治療受保傷病，並因而產生費用，保險公司將支付……膳食／飲料津貼。賠償額將相當於受保人住院期內，醫院正常、適當和實際收取的費用……」。投訴委員會從醫院提供的膳食／飲料費用細明表得悉，受保人於七天住院期間共點選了19 份甜品、18 罐能量飲料、33 杯不同的飲料或汽水、12 杯果汁等；就此，投訴委員會同意即使對於一名沒有糖尿病病徵的人士，受保人於住院期間所點選的食品和飲料實屬過量及不合理。,"Under such circumstances, the Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer’s settlement offer on the meal/beverage allowance was fair and appropriate.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pelvis, ultrasound and laboratory tests were performed during her hospitalization. The final diagnosis was fistula-in-ano and she was discharged the next day. Nine days later, the woman was re-admitted to the hospital for fistula-in-ano with fistulectomy. The insurer settled her claim for the second admission, but not the first one. The insurer explained that the first admission was not medically necessary and its main purpose was for pre-operative assessment. Also, the diagnostic tests done during the first admission could have been effectively
performed on an outpatient setting and the admission was of no emergency need.",一位女士因肛周腫脹和疼痛及右上腹疼痛持續兩星期入住私家醫院，住院期間接受骨盆磁力共振、超聲波及化驗，最終診斷結果肛瘺，於翌日出院。九天後，她再度入院接受瘻管切除手術。保險公司僅向她發放第二次的住院賠償，卻不予受理她首次住院的索償。保險公司解釋，受保人首次住院並沒有醫療需要，其主要目的是為手術前作評估；況且，在首次住院進行的診斷性檢查大可於門診診所有效地進行，住院亦屬非緊急性質。,"It is stipulated in the contract provisions of the hospitalization policy that “medically necessary” means “a medical service which is (a) consistent with the diagnosis and customary western medical treatment for the condition; (b) in accordance with standards of good medical practice…” There is also a policy exclusion statingthat “no benefit will be payable if the treatment is a direct or indirect consequence of general checkup or health tests… or diagnosis of an insured’s sickness, injury or any treatment which is not medically necessary and which can be done on outpatient basis”. The Complaints Panel noted from the available information that the insured’s first admission was mainly for carrying out diagnostic tests in order to evaluate the provisional diagnosis of fistula-in-ano. There was no active treatment given during the confinement. As MRI and ultrasound could have been performed safely and effectively on an outpatient basis and there was no evidence to support that the insured’s condition was of urgent or emergency nature, the Complaints Panel supported the insurer’s view that the first admission was not medically necessary.",有關住院保單的條款訂明：「醫療必須」是指「符合以下條件的醫療服務：（a）診斷及治療按照慣常西醫手法；（b）符合醫療專業操守……」；而保單的「不保事項」條款亦訂明：「本保單將不賠償直接或間接因一般身體檢查或健康測試……或受保人因傷病接受並非醫療必須的診斷或治療，及可於門診完成之醫療服務而引致的治療……」。投訴委員會從現有的資料得悉，受保人首次住院主要是為接受診斷性檢查，以評估肛瘺的初步診斷，她於住院期間沒有接受任何特定治療。由於磁力共振及超聲波檢查大可安全及有效地於門診診所進行，加上現時沒有證據支持受保人的病況屬緊急性質，投訴委員會遂支持保險公司的決定，認同受保人首次住院沒有醫療需要。,"The Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer’s decision to decline the insured’s first hospitalization claim for about HK$15,500.","投訴委員會贊同保險公司拒絕受保人首次住院的索償，涉及金額約 15,500 港元。","If there is concrete evidence showing that the hospital confinement is arranged solely for conducting diagnostic or laboratory tests with no element of medical emergency, the Complaints Panel will generally agree that such confinement is not medically necessary under the provisions of a hospitalization policy.

She finally stayed in the hospital for 52 days. Magnetic resonance imaging, laboratory, x-ray, ECG examination, etc. were performed during her confinement.

The Complaints Panel learnt from the attending doctor that the complainant’s condition was complicated by multiple symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, labile blood pressure and left side weakness, which accounted for her long hospital stay. She was discharged after all the symptoms subsided. As the complainant’s oxygen and blood level were not yet stable and she still required oxygen therapy and titration of medicine in the last week of her hospital stay, the Complaints Panel agreed that she was medically justified for hospital stay during her last week of confinement.",有關住院保單的條款訂明:「必要的醫療服務」指「治療病痛、不適、疾病或受傷所必須的醫療或保健服務，而有關服務：（i）須符合病情的診斷及慣常療法；（ii）須符合良好和謹慎的行醫標準；（iii）並非為了方便投保人、受保人或註冊醫生；及（iv）須為承保服務及在正常及慣常費用下進行」。投訴委員會留意到主診醫生指投訴人的病況因為出現了多項病徵，包括：胸痛、呼吸急促、暈眩、血壓不穩、左身無力而變得複雜，需要長時間留院，並在所有病徵消退後出院。由於投訴人於最後一週住院時的含氧量及血壓仍未穩定，需要接受氧氣治療及控制藥物劑量，投訴委員會因此認為她最後一週的住院有醫療需要。,"The Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer should reimburse the complainant’s hospital expenses incurred during the last week of her confinement, amounting to around HK$20,500.","投訴委員會裁定保險公司需向投訴人賠付她最後一週的住院費用，金額約 20,500 港元。","In deciding whether or not a hospital confinement is medically necessary, the Complaints Panel takes into consideration the medical condition of the insured at the time of his/her confinement and the medical treatments he/she received during the confinement.",在處理涉及住院是否醫療必須的糾紛時，投訴委員會會考慮受保人在住院時的病況及於住院期間所接受的治療。

He was recommended to have chemotherapy treatment. He was then treated with Obinutuzumab-ProMACECytaBOM (OPC) as the first-line treatment for his lymphoma. The insured subsequently filed a number of hospitalization claims to the insurer for the hospital expenses incurred during his five confinements for receiving chemotherapy treatment. The insurer considered that the aforesaid chemotherapy drugs were not the standard treatment regimen for diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Since there was a lack of medical evidence to support the safe and effective use of OPC, the insurer reimbursed the insured the hospital expenses incurred except those expenses related to the chemotherapy drugs on the grounds that the treatment was not medically necessary",受保人被診斷患上原發縱膈型大型 B 細胞淋巴瘤第二期（屬瀰漫性大型 B 細胞淋巴瘤的一個子類型），獲建議接受化療，主診醫生處方 Obinutuzumab-ProMACE-CytaBOM (OPC)作為化療的一線藥物。受保人其後五次入院接受化療，並就相關的住院費用向保險公司提出住院索償。保險公司認為有關化療藥物並非治療瀰漫性大型 B 細胞淋巴瘤的標準藥物，由於缺乏醫療證據支持 OPC 為安全及有效的藥物，保險公司因此以相關治療並非醫療必須為理由，僅向受保人賠付除化療藥物以外的住院費用。,"It is stipulated in the policy provisions of the hospitalization plan that “…the insurer shall not be liable to pay expenses incurred directly or indirectly in connection with and/or for, or in relation to treatment, medical service, medication or investigation which is not medically necessary” while “medically necessary” means “the necessity to have a treatment, medical service or medication which is:
(a) consistent with the diagnosis and customary medical treatment for the condition at a normal and customary charge…
(c) necessary for such a diagnosis or treatment…
(e) furnished at the most appropriate level which can be safely andeffectively provided to the insured…”.
The Complaints Panel learnt from the attending physician thatthe insured suffered from a distinct form of lymphoma, which wasdifferent from diffuse large B cell lymphoma as currently classified bythe World Health Organization. Since it did not respond well to theconventional treatment for diffuse large B cell lymphoma, the insured was treated with a more intensive regimen, comprising of type II antiCD20 antibody Obinutuzumab and regimen ProMACE-CytaBOM. Such therapy was medically necessary to improve the treatment outcome of the insured. As the insurer was unable to adduce further evidence to prove that the aforesaid chemotherapy drugs were unsafe and ineffective, the Complaints Panel was convinced that the use of OPC was medically necessary for the insured’s lymphoma.","有關住院保單的條款訂明：「……保險公司將不會負責因非醫療必須的治療、醫療服務、藥物或檢驗而直接或間接引致的費用」；而「醫療必須」乃指「醫療上必須的治療、醫療服務或藥物，並須：
(a) 以正常及慣常費用就病症之診斷提供相應之治療……
(c) 就有關診斷或治療而所需的……

投訴委員會從主診醫生得悉受保人患上一種罕見的淋巴瘤，與世界衛生組織現時對瀰漫性大型 B 細胞淋巴瘤的分類不同。由於針對瀰漫性大型 B 細胞淋巴瘤的傳統治療方法對
受保人的淋巴瘤未見療效，主診醫生逐採用力度較強的治療方案，包括第二代抗 CD20 抗體藥物 Obinutuzumab 及 ProMACE-CytaBOM化療法，在醫學上對改善受保人的治療結果
是必須的。鑑於保險公司未能提出更多的證據證明有關化療藥物是不安全和欠缺療效，投訴委員會因此相信處方 OPC 藥物醫治受保人的淋巴瘤乃屬醫療必須的治療。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insured and resolved that the insurer should settle his hospital expenses related to the chemotherapy drugs, amounting to around HK$190,000.","投訴委員會裁定受保人得直，保險公司需向他賠付約 190,000 港元的化療藥物費用。","Nearly all hospitalization policies exclude those medical treatments or operations which are experimental or unproven in their efficacy.

Since babies come in all shapes and sizes and the insured had been growing along the curve for his size of baby, the Complaints Panel found it acceptable for the complainant to provide a negative answer on the application form when being asked if the insured had any physical defects or shown any signs of slow physical or mental development.",投訴委員會從受保人的兒童健康紀錄冊得悉他一直維持在生長曲線圖的第三百分位線上，於 12 個月大時的身高和體重均在男孩的正常生長範圍內。由於不同嬰孩的發展均有差異，而受保人一直按照與其體型相若的嬰兒的生長曲線圖成長，投訴委員會因此認為投訴人於投保申請書內被問及受保人是否有缺陷或心理上或心智發展緩慢的跡象時，回答「否」是可以接受。,"As the grounds for the insurer to decline the complainant’s claim for Early Stage Major Disease Benefit was not strong, the Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the complainant and awarded him the said benefit of about HK$234,000.","由於保險公司拒絕向投訴人賠償早期危疾保障的理據不太充分，投訴委員會因此裁定投訴人得直，保險公司需賠付他約 234,000 港元的早期危疾保障。","The Complaints Panel reminds consumers that the information given by an applicant on the application form has significant impact on the insurer’s underwriting assessment. From the information given on the application form, the insurer can identify high-risk features and decide whether or not to take the risk and at what premium and terms. However, if the non-disclosed information is not a fact which the insured could reasonably be expected to disclose or the insured has answered the questions on the application form honestly and completely to his best knowledge and belief, the Complaints Panel may rule in favour of the claimant.",投訴委員會提醒消費者，投保人在投保申請書上提供的資料，對保險公司的核保評估影響重大；保險公司會根據投保申請書上的資料，判斷是否有高風險的特徵，從而決定應否承保有關風險、釐定保費水平和保險合約條款。然而，如果沒有披露的資料並不屬投保人認知範圍內並在合理預期下需要披露的重要事實，或受保人已根據他認知和相信的事實如實和全面地回答投保申請書上的問題，投訴委員會或會裁定受保人得直。

The insurer issued the policy at standard rate after duly assessed the declared health information. About two years later, the insured was admitted to a private hospital in China for right papillary thyroid carcinoma. He filed a critical illness claim to the insurer for cancer benefit. Upon claims investigation, the insurer found that the insured had outpatient consultations eight months and 14 months prior to policy application for bronchitis and renal disease respectively. Since such information was material which would have affected the insurer’s underwriting decision, the insurer declined the critical illness claim and rescinded the policy on the grounds of material non-disclosure.",受保人向保險公司投購危疾保障，在投保申請書上申報於四年前因接受聲帶瘜肉切除手術及於四個月前因頸椎病入住內地私家醫院。保險公司經考慮他所申報的病歷資料後，以標準條款繕發保單。約兩年後，受保人因右甲狀腺乳頭狀癌入住內地私家醫院，隨後就癌症向保險公司提出危疾索償。於調查索償期間，保險公司得悉受保人在投保八個月和十四個月前分別因支氣管炎和腎病於門診求診。由於有關資料為重要事實，會影響保險公司的承保決定，保險公司遂以他沒有披露重要事實為理由，拒絕其危疾索償申請，並撤銷保單。,"According to the insured, the non-disclosed two outpatient consultations for bronchitis and renal disease were trivial matters which did not require much medical attention.

Insurers trust the insureds to give precise and true details of the subject matter to be insured. This is called the principle of “Utmost Good Faith”. The nature of the subject matter of insurance and the circumstances pertaining to it are facts within the knowledge of the insureds. Insurers, on the other hand, are not aware of these facts unless the insureds tell them. The insureds, therefore, should always take care to tell the whole truth. Non-disclosure arises when an applicant for an insurance policy fails to disclose on the application form facts within his/her knowledge. If the non-disclosed fact is a material fact which is within the knowledge of the insured and which the insured could reasonably be expected to disclose, the Complaints Panel will generally support the insurer’s rejection of claim for material non-disclosure even though the non-disclosed information may not be related to the current illness. This is because the non-disclosure has prejudiced the insurer from making a fair and accurate underwriting assessment. The Complaints Panel reminds all insureds that “if in doubt as to whether a fact is material, it would be advisable to disclose it”.",保險合約建基於信任，保險公司信任投保人會對投保事項提供準確和真實的資料，此之謂「最高誠信原則」。投保事項的性質，以及與之相關的各種狀況，均是投保人認知範圍內的事實，除非投保人主動相告，否則，保險公司不會知道。因此，投保人有責任交代所有事實。如果投保人在投保時沒有披露已知的事實，則會被視為沒有披露事實。沒有披露的資料屬投保人認知範圍內，並在合理預期下需要披露的重要事實，投訴委員會一般會支持保險公司以沒有披露重要事實為理由拒絕賠償，即使沒有披露的資料與索償的病症沒有關係，因為沒有披露的事實令保險公司無法作出公平及準確的承保決定。投訴委員會提醒所有投保人：如不確定某些事實是否重要，最好還是加以披露。

He declared clean health history on the application form and the insurer then issued the policy on standard terms. Seven months after policy issuance, the insured sustained left low back injury with prolapsed intervertebral disc after lifting a heavy object at work. The diagnosis was left low back accidental injury. The attending doctor stated that his injury was not due to any degenerative change and there was redness and swelling noted at the first consultation after the injury. The insured was granted sick leave for 32 days. He submitted an accident claim to the insurer for disability benefit. During claims investigation, the insurer found that the insured had a history of spinal surgery done in 1980 due to prolapsed intervertebral disc. Since the insured failed to disclose the aforesaid medical history at the time of policy application, the insurer declined his accident claim on the grounds of material non-disclosure.",受保人投購附有意外附加保障的人壽保單，於投保申請書上申報健康病歷，保險公司遂以標準條款繕發保單。保單生效七個月後，受保人因在工作時提重物導致左下背受傷和椎間盤突出，最終診斷結果為左下背意外受傷。主診醫生指出，受保人的受傷並非因任何退化導致，他在受傷後首次求診時背部呈現紅腫。受保人獲發 32 天病假，向保險公司就傷殘保障提出意外索償。於審核索償期間，保險公司得悉受保人在1980 年曾因椎間盤突出接受脊椎手術。由於受保人在投保時沒有申報有關病歷資料，保險公司遂以他沒有披露重要事實為理由，拒絕其意外索償。,The Complaints Panel noted that the insured’s spinal surgery was done some 37 years before his policy application and there was no evidence showing that he had received continuous follow-up consultation or treatment relating to his spinal problem. The Complaints Panel therefore believed that the non-disclosed medical history of the insured was too remote to be considered as material information which would have affected the underwriting decision of the insurer. ,投訴委員會留意到有關脊椎手術是在受保人投保大約 37 年前進行，由於沒有證據顯示他持續接受與脊椎問題相關的覆診或治療，投訴委員會因此認為沒有披露的病歷資料發生太久遠，不應被視為會影響保險公司承保決定的重要事實。,"The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insured and awarded him the accident claim of about HK$56,000.","投訴委員會裁定受保人得直，保險公司需作出意外賠償，涉及金額約 56,000 港元。","In dealing with non-disclosure disputes, the Complaints Panel focuses mainly on whether or not the non-disclosed fact is:

2. a fact within the knowledge of the applicant; and
3. a fact which the applicant could reasonably be expected to disclose.
The Complaints Panel is mindful of whether or not it is fair and reasonable to expect an insured to disclose a particular piece of information alleged by the insurer to be a material fact. If there is no concrete and objective evidence to prove how a single incident of a particular medical condition and/or a treatment occurred long time prior to the policy application would have affected the insurer’s underwriting decision, the Complaints Panel believes that it would be unfair and unreasonable for the insurer to base solely on that medical condition to decline a claim for material non-disclosure.","於審議涉及沒有披露事實的糾紛時，投訴委員會會集中考慮下列各點：
1) 沒有披露的資料是否重要事實，足以影響審慎的承保商決定應該接受或拒絕承保，或如何釐定保費和保單條款及條件；
2) 投保人是否知道有關事實；
3) 在正常情況下，預期投保人披露有關事實是否合理。
投訴委員會會仔細考慮預期受保人披露某項被保險公司視為重要事實的資料，是否對受保人公平和合理。如果沒有具體及客觀的證據，證明某單一出現的特定病況及／或在投保一段長時間前接受的治療會影響保險公司的承保決定，投訴委員會相信保險公司純粹以受保人沒有披露該病況屬重要事實，繼而拒絕賠償並不公平和合理。"

The boy’s father (the complainant) filed a claim to the insurer for the Chinese Medicine Practitioner (CMP) treatment under the optional outpatient benefit of his medical policy. The insurer initially declined the claim as no medical consultation had taken place during the aforesaid period when the herbal medicines were dispensed. However, the insurer subsequently agreed to grant an exceptional offer to the complainant and settle his claim in full on the condition that no similar claim would be allowed in future. The complainant rejected the offer and filed another claim to the insurer for the insured’s medical expenses incurred from 16 July to 8 October 2018. Other than the herbal medicine expenses, there was also a consultation fee and four acupuncture treatments. The insurer settled the expenses for the consultation and the acupuncture treatments, but declined the claim for the herbal medicine expenses on the grounds that there was no evidence showing that medical consultations had taken place when the medicines were dispensed.",一位十歲男孩自六歲起因進食引致食物敏感和皮膚炎。他於 2018 年 5 月 29 日至 7 月 15日期間每天服用由美國的西方過敏病專家處方的中藥，男孩的父親（投訴人）就其醫療保單之自選門診保障內的中醫治療向保險公司提出索償。由於受保人在上述獲配發藥物的日子並沒有應診，保險公司最初拒絕有關索償，惟其後同意作出特別安排，向投訴人全數賠償，條件是日後不會再就同類型的索償作出賠償。投訴人拒絕接納保險公司的賠償建議，並就受保人於 2018 年 7 月 16 日至 10 月 8 日期間的醫療費用向保險公司提出另一宗索償，當中除了中藥費外，還涉及一次應診費和四次針灸費。保險公司向投訴人賠付了應診費及針灸費，但拒絕就中藥費作出賠償，原因是沒有證據證明有關中藥是於受保人應診時配發。,"It is stipulated in the “CMP Treatment” under the optional outpatient benefit of the medical policy that “If during the period of insurance, an insured, as a result of a disability, is treated in a clinic or the outpatient department of a hospital as an outpatient or day patient, eligible expenses shall be payable in respect of CMP Treatment – charges for the consultation rendered by a CMP for Chinese medicine treatment including bone-setting and charges for medicine dispensed at the clinic or hospital where the medical consultation takes place”. Having duly studied all the information available, the Complaints Panel was given to understand that the insured had been covered under his father’s group medical plan since November 2011 and his current individual medical plan was effected in April 2017. Both plans were provided by the insurer. The insured had received CMP treatment since July 2014 for his food allergy and dermatitis. All along, the insurer had fully settled the herbal medicine expenses incurred by the insured on a daily basis as long as the receipt for each dispense ofherbal medicines was submitted. Even after the individual plan was effected, the insured’s herbal medicine expenses from 10 April 2017 to 28 May 2018 was also settled by the insurer based on the samemethodology. The Complaints Panel observed that the insurer had waived some of the claim requirements in handling the complainant’s claims in respect of the CMP treatment for the insured since July 2014. Although the Complaints Panel concurred that the insurer had the right to revoke such wavier and to assess the claim strictly in accordance to the policy terms and conditions, the insurer bore the liability to explicitly inform the complainant of such measure.

符合索償資格的費用：由中醫師因進行中醫治療（包括跌打）而提供的診症及於接受診症之診所或醫院配發藥物所招致之費用」。經考慮所有資料後，投訴委員會得悉受保人自 2011 年 11 月起受保於其父親公司的團體醫療計劃，而現時的個人醫療計劃則於 2017年 4 月生效，兩份保單均由保險公司承保。受保人自 2014 年 7 月起因食物敏感和皮膚炎接受中藥治療，一直以來，只要提交每次配發藥物的收據，保險公司便會全數支付受保人每天的中藥費用。即使在個人醫療保單生效後，保險公司一直以同一方法賠付受保人由 2017 年 4 月 10 日至 2018 年 5 月 28 日的中藥費用。投訴委員會留意到保險公司自 2014 年 7 月起在處理投訴人就中醫治療保障的索償申請時已豁免執行部分理賠要求。雖然投訴委員會同意保險公司有權撤銷有關豁免，並嚴格根據保單的條款及條件審核索償，但保險公司有責任清晰地通知投訴人有關措施。","Given that the insurer only notified the complainant on 12 October2018 that similar claims in future would not be accepted, theComplaints Panel resolved that the insurer should fully settle theinsured’s herbal medicine expenses at least up to 12 October 2018.The amount involved was around HK$50,000.

The Complaints Panel learnt from the press release issued by Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) dated 14 August 2019 that nearly 1,000 flights were cancelled during the five consecutive days from 9 to 13 August and participants of the public assemblies had caused serious disruption to airport and flights operations. Having duly reviewed all the available information, the Complaints Panel was convinced that the flight cancellation suffered by the insured and her family on 14 August 2019 was very likely a subsequent 
outcome of the HKIA events on 12 and 13 August. Given that the insurer had made a special travel claims arrangement to offer policyholders the travel delay cash allowance for flight delays in response to the HKIA events on these two days, the Complaints Panel 
considered that the insurer should also extend such special claims arrangement to the insured and her family.","有關「旅程延誤」保障的條款訂明：「倘受保人在旅程中計劃乘搭之公共交通工具因罷工或其他工業行動、暴動、內亂、騎劫、恐怖主義活動、自然災害、惡劣天氣狀況、公共交通工具機件及／或電力故障而遲於原定班次時間出發，保險公司會以保障列表上所示的最高保障額為限，向受保人作出下列賠償：

","The Complaints Panel resolved that the insurer should pay the insured and her family the travel delay cash allowance of HK$4,500 in total."," 投訴委員會裁定保險公司需向受保人一家發放合共 4,500 港元的旅程延誤現金津貼。","Travel delay benefit provides compensation to policyholders in the event that the scheduled flight is delayed for at least the specified number of hours due to adverse weather conditions, natural disaster, mechanical failure of common carriers, strike, riot, civil commotion, etc. In determining disputes involving travel delay benefit, apart from the cause of flight delay stated in the certificates from the airlines, the Complaints Panel also considers the actual circumstances of the delay, as well as related news and facts from relevant authorities.",「旅程延誤」保障為投保人因預定航班受到惡劣天氣、天然災害、公共交通工具機械故障、罷工、暴動、騷亂等事故而延誤至少達某特定時數提供補償。在處理涉及旅程延誤的糾紛時，除了航空公司在證明書中註明的航班延誤原因外，投訴委員會亦會考慮導致該延誤的實際情況，以及相關公共機構發放的新聞和提供的事實。

The family originally intended to take the flight departing from Hong Kong to Osaka at 00:50 on 14 August 2019. In order to avoid any delay in reaching the airport due to the chaos arising from the public assembly at the airport at that period, they arrived the airport early at about 17:00 on 13 August. However, they were eventually informed by the airline that the flight would be cancelled. They then decided to cancel their trip. A full refund for the flight tickets was received from the airline. The complainant subsequently filed a claim to the insurer for the irrecoverable hotel accommodation expenses under the trip cancellation benefit. Given that the flight cancellation was due to local disruption of airport facility in Hong Kong, not at the planned destination, the insurer declined the complainant’s claim for the trip cancellation benefit.",投訴人及家人計劃於 2019 年 8 月 14 至 18 日到大阪旅遊，並購買旅遊保險。他們原定乘坐 2019 年 8 月 14 日零時 50分由香港飛往大阪的航班，由於機場在那段時間受公眾集會影響而出現混亂，為避免任何延誤，他們提早於 8 月 13日約下午五時便抵達機場。然而，航空公司其後通知他們所乘坐的航班會被取消，投訴人一家遂決定取消旅程。他們獲航空公司退回全部機票費用，其後投訴人根據旅遊保單內的「取消行程」保障向保險公司申索未能退回的酒店費用。由於航班取消乃因香港機場設施受阻導致，並非發生於計劃目的地，保險公司因此拒絕向投訴人賠償「取消行程」保障。,"It is stipulated in the “trip cancellation” benefit of the policy that “the insurer shall reimburse the insured person… for the irrecoverable loss of transportation and/or accommodation expenses paid in advance by the insured person or for which the insured person is legally liable and not recoverable from any other source upon cancellation of the journey or any scheduled destination arising due to: (c) unexpected outbreak of strike or other industrial action, riot, civil commotion… at the planned destination arising within one week before the departure date of the journey.”It was stated in the certificate for cancellation issued by the airline that the reason for flight cancellation was local disruption of airport facility in Hong Kong. Given that the disruption of airport facility occurred in Hong Kong, not at the planned destination, the Complaints Panel agreed with the insurer that the claim did not meet the policy terms and conditions.","有關旅遊保單內「取消行程」保障的條款訂明：「……在旅程或旅程任何一個目的地出於下列原因而取消時，保險公司會就受保人無法討回的預付交通及住宿費用之損失，或受保人因此需要承擔法律責任且無法從任何其他方面討回的損失作出賠償：
(c)	於旅程出發日前一個星期內，計劃目的地出現非預期的罷工或其他工業行動、暴動、內亂……」
根據航空公司發出的航班取消證明顯示，航班取消的原因為香港機場設施中斷。由於機場設施中斷發生在香港，而非計劃目的地，投訴委員會認同投訴人的申索不符合保單的條款和條件。","The Complaints Panel endorsed the insurer’s decision in declining the complainant’s claim for trip cancellation benefit of around HK$3,000."," 投訴委員會贊同保險公司拒絕向投訴人賠償「取消行程」保障的決定，涉及金額約 3,000港元。","All insurance contracts contain an insuring clause which specifies the types, nature and circumstances of loss covered by the policy. If an incident is not caused by a specified insured peril or if the circumstances leading to a loss do not fulfil the terms and conditions as stipulated in the policy provisions, the Complaints Panel will usually support the insurer to decline the claim.",所有保險合約均清楚列明承保條款，詳細交待合約將承保的損失類別、性質及情況。假如某宗事故並非因指定的受保風險導致，又或引致損失的情況並不符合保單訂明的條款和條件，投訴委員會一般會支持保險公司拒絕賠償的決定。
2020-2021,Travel ,Application of policy terms,保單條款的詮釋,3,"Travel Delay 
(train suspension caused by typhoon)",旅程延誤（因颱風導致火車暫停）,,,"The complainant took out a travel insurance policy with the insurer for his trip to Tokyo from 6 to 9 September 2019. On the day he intended to return to Hong Kong, all the land transport to Narita Airport was closed due to typhoon. As he was unable to get to the airport, he stayed in Tokyo for one night and took the rescheduled flight offered by the airline the next day at no extra costs. The total delay hours were around 16 hours. After returned to Hong Kong, he filed a claim to the insurer for the additional hotel expenses incurred under the travel delay benefit. According to the certificate issued by the train operator, the train services were suspended on 9 September 2019 due to typhoon and were resumed on 10 September. As the certificate did not state the actual delay hours, the insurer declined the complainant’s claim on the grounds that there was not enough evidence to prove the claim fell within the provisions of the travel delay benefit. The complainant was not satisfied with the insurer’s decision. He submitted a local newspaper which confirmed that all the train services were suspended on 9 September 2019 until 8:00 am the next day due to typhoon to support his case. However, the insurer maintained its decision to decline the claim.
",投訴人為 2019 年 9 月 6 日至9日往東京旅行購買旅遊保險。在他原定返回香港的那天，所有前往成田機場的陸路交通因颱風而停止服務，由於他無法前往機場，於是留宿東京一晚，並於第二天乘坐由航空公司重新安排的航班返港，毋須繳付額外費用，總延誤時數約16小時。回港後，他就旅遊保單內的「旅程延誤」保障向保險公司申索額外的酒店費用。根據鐵路公司發出的證明顯示，火車服務因受颱風吹襲於 2019 年 9 月 9 日暫停，並於9月10日恢復。由於有關證明沒有說明實際延誤的時數，保險公司拒絕投訴人的索償申請，原因是沒有充足的證據證明有關索償符合「旅程延誤」保障的條款。投訴人不滿保險公司的決定，他提交一份當地報紙以支持他的個案，有關報章指出所有火車服務因颱風關係於 2019年 9 月 9 日暫停運作，直至翌日上午八時。然而，保險公司堅持不予賠償。,"It is stipulated in the “travel delay” benefit of the travel insurance policy that “in the event the insured’s covered trip is delayed by a public common carrier due to adverse weather conditions… and the delay exceeds six consecutive hours from the time specified in the itinerary, the insurer will pay the amount of benefit stated… for each and every full six consecutive hours delayed, up to the maximum stated... The period of delay is counted from the originally scheduled time of departure of the arranged public common carrier to the actual departure time of the arranged public common carrier or first available alternative transportation offered by the relevant public common carrier, whichever is lesser.” The Complaints Panel noted that the insurer was willing to offer HK$600 (i.e. HK$300 per each full 6-hour delay x 2) to the complainant after duly considered the opinions given by the Honorary Secretaries. However, it received no reply from the complainant on the revised offer. Given that there was concrete evidence showing that the complainant’s return flight to Hong Kong was delayed for around 16 hours due to adverse weather condition, the Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer’s subsequent offer of HK$600 for the claim. On the other hand, since the travel delay benefit did not provide coverage for additional accommodation expenses, the Complaints Panel agreed with the insurer’s decision in rejecting the claim for the hotel expenses incurred by the complainant on 9 September 2019.",有關旅遊保單內「旅程延誤」保障的條款訂明 :「於受保人出發後，如受保旅程因惡劣天氣……引致所乘的公共交通工具延誤……而延誤較行程表上訂明的時間超過連續六小時，保險公司會就每滿連續六小時的延誤作出賠償，以最高賠償額為上限……延誤的時間由受保人行程表上訂明的公共交通工具的原定出發時間起計，直至該公共交通工具的實際出發時間，或由相關公共交通工具營運商安排的首班替代交通工具的實際出發時間，以較少者為準。」投訴委員會得悉保險公司考慮了名譽顧問的意見後，同意向投訴人作出 600 港元的賠償（即每滿六小時的延誤賠償 300 港元ｘ 2），但投訴人沒有就有關賠償建議作出回覆。鑑於現有證據顯示投訴人回港的航班因惡劣天氣狀況而延誤了約 16 小時，投訴委員會贊同保險公司其後作出600港元的賠償建議。另一方面，由於「旅程延誤」保障並沒有為額外住宿費用提供保障，投訴委員會同意保險公司拒絕就投訴人 2019 年 9 月 9 日入住酒店的費用作出賠償。,"Under such circumstances, the Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer’s subsequent offer of HK$600 to the complainant in respect of the travel delay benefit claim was fair and appropriate.",在這情況下，投訴委員會裁定保險公司其後就「旅程延誤」保障向投訴人作出 600港元的賠償建議的決定公平和合理。,"Most travel insurance policies provide cover for travel delay of common carriers. The insurer will pay the insured a specified amount of compensation for a specified number of hours of delay up to a maximum limit if the delay is caused by an insured peril. When determining the merits of such cases, other than certificates issued by airlines or operators of public common carriers, the Complaints Panel also considers other valid evidence in support of the case.",大部分旅遊保單提供公共交通工具延誤保障，假如有關延誤是因受保風險引致，保險公司會按指定延誤時數向受保人發放指定賠償金額，惟不超過最高限額。在處理這類個案時，除了航空公司或公共交通工具營運商發出的證明外，投訴委員會還會考慮其他支持有關個案的合理證據。

(systematic lupus erythematosus)",投保前已存在的病狀（系統性紅斑狼瘡）,,,"The complainant had fever on the day before she commenced her trip to South Korea. She attended a public hospital and was advised not fit for travel. She then cancelled her trip. She was admitted to hospital 10 days later due to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The complainant filed a claim to the insurer for the journey cancellation benefit under her travel insurance policy. However, her claim was rejected on the grounds of “pre-existing condition” exclusion. The insurer considered that the complainant’s fever was related to her SLE which was diagnosed more than 10 years ago.",投訴人出發到南韓旅行的前一天因發燒到公立醫院求診，被建議不適宜旅行，她於是取消旅程。投訴人在 10 天後因系統性紅斑狼瘡入院。投訴人就取消旅程向保險公司提出旅遊索償，然而，保險公司以投保前已存在病狀的不保事項，不予接納她的索償，保險公司認為投訴人的發燒與她十多年前被確診患上的系統性紅斑狼瘡有關。,"It is stipulated in the “General Exclusions” provisions of the travel insurance policy that “the insurer will not pay for any claim arising directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection with any pre-existing conditions… ” while “pre-existing condition” means “any sickness or disease, injury or medical condition of the insured person, immediate family member, close business partner or travelling companion (a)which required investigation, treatment or medication or advice from a qualified medical practitioner prior to the effective date of the policy; or (b) which presented signs or symptoms that any such person mentioned above was aware of or should have reasonably been aware of and for which a reasonable person would have sought medical treatment or advice from a qualified medical practitioner prior to the effective date of the policy.” The Complaints Panel learnt that the complainant had received regular
blood test to monitor her anti-dsDNA level since she was diagnosed with SLE and her anti-dsDNA level was above the reference level six months before her trip. Given that the complainant was subsequently diagnosed with SLE following her fever which manifested the day before the commencement of her trip and that she had been under constant monitoring of her SLE condition, the Complaints Panel was convinced that her current fever was likely caused by the chronic disease of SLE, which was a condition pre-existed prior to the policy
effective date.",涉案旅遊保單內的「主要不保項目」條款訂明：「保險公司不會賠償任何保單內直接或間接因任何受保前已存在之狀況……而引致的索償」；而「受保前已存在之狀況」是指「在保單生效日前，受保人、直系親屬、密切商業夥伴或旅遊夥伴的任何疾病、病症、受傷或醫療狀況：（a）需要合格醫生的研究、治療、藥物治療或醫療意見；或（b）以上所提及的人士已知悉或應合理地已知悉所出現的病徵或症狀及一位合理人士將因此病徵或症狀而到合格醫生診症或治療。」投訴委員會得悉投訴人自被確診患上系統性紅斑狼瘡後一直定期接受血液檢測，以監察抗雙鏈去氧核糖核酸抗體（dsDNA抗體）的水平，她在旅程出發六個月前的dsDNA抗體水平超出正常參考值。鑑於投訴人於出發前一天發燒，其後被確診患上系統性紅斑狼瘡，加上她一直就相關病況接受定期監察，投訴委員會因此相信投訴人是次發燒很大機會是因慢性系統性紅斑狼瘡導致，屬保單生效前已存在的情況。,"The Complaints Panel endorsed the insurer’s decision in declining the journey cancellation benefit on the grounds of “pre-existing condition” exclusion. The amount involved was about HK$4,000.

She consulted a localdoctor the next day presenting with pain at elbows, legs and left buttock. After she returned to Hong Kong, she sought consultation from a medical practitioner and was diagnosed as suffering from injuries to elbows, legs and lower back. She was then referred to have physiotherapy treatment. The complainant received a total of three medical consultations, one x-ray examination and 32 sessions of physiotherapy treatment during the three months following her return from Australia. The insurer questioned about the frequency of the complainant’s physiotherapy treatment and believed that the usual physiotherapy treatment for soft tissues injuries would be limited to 10 to 15 sessions. It initially proposed a settlement offer which comprised of two medical consultations and 17 sessions of physiotherapy. The complainant refused the offer. After several rounds of negotiations, the insurer finally agreed to increase the offer to include three medical consultations, one x-ray examination and 25 sessions of physiotherapy. However, the complainant still did not accept the offer.",投訴人在澳洲旅遊時不慎在酒店浴室滑倒，於翌日因手肘、腳及左臀疼痛向當地醫生求診；返港後，她接受私家醫生治療，診斷結果為手肘、雙腳及下背受傷，並獲轉介接受物理治療。投訴人自澳洲回港後的三個月內共接受了三次門診治療、一次 X 光檢查及 32 次物理治療。保險公司認為軟組織受傷一般只需接受 10 至 15 次物理治療，故質疑投訴人接受物理治療的次數。保險公司最初建議向投訴人賠償兩次門診治療及 17 次物理治療，惟被投訴人拒絕。經過多次磋商後，保險公司最終同意提高賠償至三次門診治療、一次 X 光檢查及 25 次物理治療，然而，投訴人仍不接納有關修訂賠償建議。,"The Complaints Panel noted from a medical report issued by the attending doctor that the complainant still had low back pain with limited movement two months after the accident. X-ray of lumbar spine was thus recommended to exclude bony injury. Furthermore, according to the patient record of the physiotherapy centre, the complainant suffered from persistent low back pain and calf pain during the period she received the physiotherapy treatments. There was an improvement of around 70-80% two and a half months after the accident. Based on the evidence available, the Complaints Panel was convinced that the x-ray examination and the physiotherapy treatments were necessary to treat the complainant’s soft tissue injury sustained in the slip and fall accident. There was no concrete proof that the physiotherapy sessions were excessive.",投訴委員會從主診醫生的醫療報告得悉，投訴人於意外發生兩個月後仍有下背痛，且活動能力受限，因此獲建議接受腰椎 X 光以排除骨骼受傷。此外，根據物理治療中心的病人紀錄，投訴人於接受物理治療期間持續有下背及小腿疼痛，於意外發生兩個半月後，她康復了大約七至八成。基於現有證據，投訴委員會相信投訴人有需要接受 X 光檢查及物理治療，以治理她因滑倒意外而引致的軟組織受傷，而現時並沒有具體證據顯示她接受的物理治療屬過多。,"The Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer should settle the complainant’s claim in full, i.e. three medical consultations, one x-ray examination and 32 sessions of physiotherapy treatment.

She declared clean health history in the application form and the policy was then issued with standard terms. She was diagnosed with left breast mastitis in November 2019 and was admitted to a private hospital to receive left breast lumpectomy. She filed a hospitalization claim
to the insurer for the hospital expenses incurred. Upon claims investigation, the insurer learnt from the medical records of several public hospitals that the insured was diagnosed with epilepsy and seizure in 1999 when she was two years old. Since then, she had regular follow-up consultations and investigations until 2017. She also suffered from upper abdominal pain in 2006, fatty liver in 2008 and some gynecological diseases from 2012 to 2018. It was stated in the report of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong that the insured had history of convulsion and migraine in childhood which was followed up in a public hospital. Given that such information was not disclosed in the policy application and that the non-disclosed information was material which would have affected the insurer’s underwriting decision, the insurer declined the insured’s hospitalization claim and rescinded the policy on the grounds of material non-disclosure. The insured disagreed with the insurer’s decision. She emphasized that she did not know she had suffered from epilepsy during her childhood when she applied for the policy.

Insurers trust the insureds to give precise and true details of the subject matter to be insured. This is called the principle of “Utmost Good Faith”. The nature of the subject matter of insurance and the circumstances pertaining to it are facts within the knowledge of the insureds. Insurers, on the other hand, are not aware of these facts unless the insureds tell them. The insureds, therefore, should always take care to tell the whole truth. Non-disclosure arises when an applicant for an insurance policy fails to disclose in the application form facts within his/her knowledge. If the non-disclosed fact is a material fact which is within the knowledge of the insured and which the insured could reasonably be expected to disclose, the Complaints Panel will generally support the insurer’s rejection of claim for material non-disclosure even though the non-disclosed information may not be related to the current illness. This is because the non-disclosure has prejudiced the insurer from making a fair and accurate underwriting assessment. The Complaints Panel reminds all insureds that “if in doubt as to whether a fact is material, it would be advisable to disclose it”.",保險合約建基於信任，保險公司信任投保人會對投保事項提供準確和真實的資料，此之謂「最高誠信原則」。投保事項的性質，以及與之相關的各種狀況，均是投保人認知範圍內的事實，除非投保人主動相告，否則保險公司不會知道。因此，投保人有責任交代所有事實。如果投保人在投保時沒有披露已知的事實，則會被視為沒有披露事實。如沒有披露的資料屬投保人認知範圍內，並在合理預期下需要披露的重要事實，投訴委員會一般會支持保險公司以沒有披露重要事實為理由拒絕賠償，即使沒有披露的資料與索償的病症沒有關係，因為沒有披露的事實令保險公司無法作出公平及準確的承保決定。投訴委員會提醒所有投保人：如不確定某些事實是否重要，最好還是加以披露。

The complainant was diagnosed with lung cancer (stage 4) and was admitted to a private hospital for 11 days to receive radiotherapy treatment (RT). The total hospital expenses incurred were around HK$510,000, of which HK$185,000 belonged to the doctors’ fees charged by three specialists for RT planning, RT computer tomography monitoring and intravenous sedation for RT planning.The insurer reimbursed the complainant nearly 75% of the total hospital expenses for the claim. The difference mainly arose from the claims settlement for the various doctors’ fees. The insurer settled such fees under the Inpatient Physician’s Fees benefit by paying an amount of HK$40,150, which was the maximum daily benefit of HK$3,650 for 11 days.The complainant was not satisfied with the claims settlement and emphasized that RT planning was an integral part of her RT which should be covered by the policy.","投訴人的醫療保單的年度總限額為130萬港元，當中包括全數「住院雜費」保障及每日3,650港元的「住院醫生巡房費」保障，每年最多 182 日。投訴人被確診患上第四期肺癌，入住私家醫院 11 天接受放射治療，總醫療開支約為 510,000 港元，當中 185,000 港元涉及三位專科醫生就放射治療規劃、電腦掃描監測及用於放射治療的靜脈鎮靜的收費。保險公司向投訴人支付了接近 75% 的總住院費用，有關差額主要源於各項醫生費用的賠償，保險公司把相關的醫生費用歸入「住院醫生巡房費」保障，作出 40,150 港元的賠償（即每日最高賠償限額 3,650 港元ｘ 11 日）。投訴人不滿有關賠償金額，強調放射治療規劃屬放射治療不可或缺的一部分，應可獲得賠償。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions that “Inpatient Physician’s Fees benefit shall be payable for attendance fee of registered medical practitioner for non-surgical hospital confinement…” whereas “Miscellaneous Hospital Services benefit shall be payable for the hospital services including… anaesthesia and oxygen, blood transfusions, drugs, medicine, films, imaging, intravenous infusions, laboratory examinations, related test and drugs fee of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, consumables used in the operating theatre… etc.” Given that RT planning fee was not specifically listed under the Miscellaneous Hospital Services benefit and the various doctors’ fees were charged by the doctors instead of the hospital, the Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer’s decision in not paying such fees under the Miscellaneous Hospital Services benefit.The Complaints Panel also noted that the Honorary Secretaries had recommended the insurer to reimburse the various doctors’ fees under the Inpatient Specialist’s Fees benefit as the three doctors were all specialists referred by the complainant’s attending doctor. The insurer subsequently agreed and re-processed such fees under the In-patient Specialist’s Fees benefit with an annual limit of HK$26,000 on an exceptional basis.","有關醫療保單的條文訂明：「『住院醫生巡房費』保障支付……因非手術性治療而住院所需之註冊西醫巡房費……而『住院雜費』保障則支付住院服務費用，包括：施行麻醉及氧氣、輸血、藥物、底片及診斷影像、靜脈注射、實驗室化驗、化學治療及放射治療的相關檢測和藥物費用、在手術室內使用的物品……」由於放射治療規劃並沒有列明在『住院雜費』保障內，加上涉及的各項醫生費用是由醫生收取，而非醫院收取，投訴委員會因此同意保險公司不把相關費用歸入「住院雜費」保障作出
賠償。投訴委員會亦留意到投訴局的名譽顧問曾建議保險公司把各項醫生費用歸入「住院專科醫生費」保障，因為涉及的三位專科醫生均是由投訴人的主診醫生轉介。基於情況特殊，保險公司其後同意按名譽顧問的建議，重新處理有關索償，並把所涉的醫生費用歸入「住院專科醫生費」保障作出賠償，該保障的每年限額為26,000 港元。","In this connection, the Complaints Panel agreed that the insurer had settled the claim in accordance with the policy terms and conditions. ",在這方面，投訴委員會認同保險公司已根據保單的條款及條件悉數作出賠償。,"In recent years, more and more people opt for supreme hospital plans which provide comprehensive “full cover” benefit to most or certain types of medical expenses. In determining which benefit an insurer should pay for a specific medical expense in a hospitalization claim, the Complaints Panel focuses on the nature of the medical expenses, the party who charged the fee as well as the relevant terms and wordings stipulated in the policy provisions.",近年，越來越多人選擇購買高端的醫療計劃，為大部分或指定類型的醫療費用提供「全數賠償」的保障。在決定保險公司應以哪一項保障支付住院索賠中指定的醫療費用時，投訴委員會會眾焦於該醫療費用的性質、收取費用的一方及保單訂明的相關條款及詞彙。

She declared clean medical history for the insured in the application form and submitted the insured’s infant record from hospital and his Child Health Booklet to the insurer at the time of policy application. The policy was then issued on standard terms. Nine months later, the insured
was admitted to a private hospital to receive endoscopic third ventriculostomy and external ventricular drainage for hydrocephalus. The mother filed a hospitalization claim to the insurer for the hospital expenses incurred. During claims investigation, the insurer learnt from the medical records of a government maternal and child health centre (MCHC) that the insured was delivered at 38 weeks via caesarean section due to fetal big head. He presented with mild neonatal jaundice for six days after the first week of birth. Furthermore, the insured attended MCHC at two months old due to head circumference greater than 97th percentile. It was noted that his father also had big head since baby. Given that the mother had not disclosed the aforesaid medical records of the insured and the family history of big head at the time of policy application, the insurer declined the hospitalization claim on the grounds of material non-disclosure.",一位母親為她兩個月大的兒子（受保人）投購住院保單，她在投保申請書上申報健康病歷，並向保險公司提交由醫院發出的受保人初生嬰兒紀錄及兒童健康紀錄冊，保險公司以標準條款繕發保單。九個月後，受保人因腦積水入住私家醫院接受內窺鏡第三腦室造口術及室外引流，該母親其後就有關醫療費用向保險公司提出住院索償。於調查索償期間，保險公司從一所公立母嬰健康院的醫療紀錄得悉，由於胎兒頭大，該母親於第 38 週進行剖腹分娩；受保人出生後一星期出現輕微初生嬰兒黃疸六天，另由於頭圍超過第 97 百分位，他於兩個月大時到母嬰健康院覆診，而紀錄顯示他父親自嬰兒時頭也偏大。基於該母親於投保時沒有申報受保人上述的醫療紀錄及有關頭大的家族史，保險公司遂以她沒有披露重要事實為理由，拒絕住院索償。,"As regards the insured’s big head condition, the Complaints Panel learnt that it was written in the infant record that the insured’s head circumference at birth was 36cm, equivalent to around 85th percentile. Although the head circumference page in the Child Health Booklet was missing, the insurer had not asked for the whole booklet for underwriting purpose. On the other side, the mother’s obstetrician clarified that the fetal head circumference was noted to be on the larger side since 29+ weeks of gestation, but there was no intracranial pathology noted during the antenatal period. Also, the health declaration in the application form did not have question asking for big head family history. In this regard, the Complaints Panel did not think that the insurer had valid grounds to decline the hospitalization claim. As regards the insured’s health history of neonatal jaundice, since it is a common condition for newborn babies while the medical records of MCHC showed that the insured’s neonatal jaundice had already been resolved prior to policy application, the Complaints Panel agreed thatit was acceptable for the mother not to make such declaration in the application form. ",有關受保人頭大的狀況，投訴委員會從醫院發出的初生嬰兒紀錄得悉，受保人於出生時的頭圍是36厘米，相等於約第85百分位。雖然兒童健康紀錄冊內欠缺了關於頭圍資料那頁，保險公司卻沒有向該母親索取整本健康紀錄冊以作核保。另一方面，該母親的婦產科醫生亦澄清，胎兒自第 29 週起被發現頭圍偏大，惟在懷孕期間並沒有出現顱內病變。此外，投保申請書上的健康問題亦沒有問及頭大的家族史。在此情況下，投訴委員會並不認為有充分理據支持保險公司拒賠的決定。至於受保人的初生嬰兒黃疸病史，由於初生嬰兒黃疸屬新生嬰兒常見的病況，而母嬰健康院的醫療紀錄亦顯示受保人的初生嬰兒黃疸於投保前已痊癒，投訴委員會因此認為該母親沒有在投保申請書上作出相關披露是可以接受。,"As the grounds for the insurer to decline the hospitalization claim was not strong, the Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the mother and awarded her an amount of about HK$300,000."," 由於保險公司拒絕住院賠償的理據不太充分，投訴委員會因此裁定該母親得直，保險公司需向她賠付約 300,000 港元的住院賠償。","The Complaints Panel reminds consumers that the information given by an applicant in the application form has significant impact on the insurer’s underwriting assessment. From the information given in the application form, the insurer can identify high-risk features and decide whether or not to take the risk and at what premium and terms. However, if the non-disclosed information is not a fact which the insured could reasonably be expected to disclose or the insured has answered the questions in the application form honestly and completely to his/her best knowledge and belief, the Complaints Panel may rule in favour of the claimant.",投訴委員會提醒消費者︰投保人在投保申請書上提供的資料，對保險公司的核保評估影響重大；保險公司會根據投保申請書上的資料，判斷是否有高風險的特徵，從而決定應否承保有關風險、釐定保費水平和保險合約條款。然而，如果沒有披露的資料並不屬投保人認知範圍內並在合理預期下需要披露的事實，或受保人已根據他認知和相信的事實如實和全面地回答投保申請書上的問題，投訴委員會或會裁定受保人得直。

He declared clean health history in the application form and submitted with the application form his health screening report done two years ago in a private hospital. Since the report revealed the presence of mild degenerative changes in his upper lumbar spine, the insurer issued the policy with an exclusion on disorder of lumbar spine. Three years later, the complainant was admitted to a private hospital to receive sleep study test and the final diagnosis was mild obstructive sleep apnea. The insurer noted that the complainant had symptoms of snoring for five to six years and choking feeling during sleep for two to three years prior to the admission. Since the complainant’s snoring problem, which is a symptom of sleep apnea, had existed prior to the policy application but had not been declared in the application form, the insurer refused to entertain his hospital claim for material non-disclosure. Had such information be declared at the time of policy application, the insurer’s underwriting decision would have been different. The insurer would have asked for the cause or diagnosis of snoring or imposed special condition to the cover.",投訴人向保險公司投購住院保單，在投保申請書上申報健康病歷，並提交他兩年前在私家醫院驗身的報告。由於報告顯示投訴人的上腰椎呈輕微退化，保險公司遂於保單附加不保事項條款，不承保腰椎疾病。三年後，投訴人入住私家醫院接受睡眠測試，最終診斷結果為輕微睡眠窒息症。保險公司得悉投訴人有打鼾症狀五至六年，而在入院兩至三年前睡眠有氣阻的感覺。由於投訴人的打鼾問題（即睡眠窒息症的症狀）在投保前已存在，而他卻沒有在投保申請書上披露，保險公司遂以他沒有披露重要事實為理由，拒絕其住院賠償。保險公司指若投訴人於投保時披露相關資料，其承保結果會有所不同，保險公司會要求投訴人提供打鼾的原因或診斷結果或於保單內附加特別條款。,"The Complaints Panel studied the health questions in the application form and located only one question relevant to the case. The question asked if the applicant had any undiagnosed symptoms in the last six months, or currently undergoing medical investigations or awaiting results for the said symptoms and the complainant answered “no”. The Complaints Panel also noted from the attending doctor that the complainant’s symptoms related to sleep apnea manifested only after the policy was effected. Since snoring at sleeping is a common phenomenon and the complainant had not sought any consultations for his snoring problem prior to the policy application, the Complaints Panel was not convinced that the complainant’s snoring was an undiagnosed symptom which had to be declared in the application form.",投訴委員會研究投保申請書上有關健康的問題，察覺到當中只有一條問題與此個案有關，該問題問及申請人在過去六個月內有否任何未診斷的症狀，或現時是否正接受檢查或正等候以上提及的症狀的結果，而投訴人則回答「沒有」。投訴委員會亦留意到主診醫生指出，與投訴人睡眠窒息症相關的症狀於保單生效後才出現。由於睡覺出現打鼾是很普遍的現象，加上投訴人於保單生效前從沒有因打鼾問題求診，投訴委員會並不認為他的打鼾屬未診斷的症狀，需要在投保申請書上申報。,"Under such circumstances, the Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the complainant and awarded him the hospitalization claim of about HK$8,000. ","在此情況下，投訴委員會裁定投訴人得直，保險公司需向他作出住院賠償，涉及的金額約8,000 港元。","In dealing with non-disclosure disputes, the Complaints Panel focuses mainly on whether or not the non-disclosed fact is:
1. a material fact which would influence a prudent underwriter in accepting or declining a risk or in fixing the premium or terms and conditions of the contract;
2. a fact within the knowledge of the applicant; and
3. a fact which the applicant could reasonably be expected to disclose.
The Complaints Panel is mindful of whether or not it is fair and reasonable to expect an insured to disclose a particular piece of information alleged by the insurer to be a material fact. If there is no concrete and objective evidence to prove how a common medical condition/symptom existed prior to the policy application would have affected the insurer’s underwriting decision, the Complaints Panel believes that it may not be fair for the insurer to base solely on that medical condition/symptom to decline a claim for material nondisclosure.","於審議涉及沒有披露事實的糾紛時，投訴委員會會集中考慮下列各點：
1)	沒有披露的資料是否重要事實，足以影響審慎的承保商決定應該接受或拒絕承保，或如何釐定保費和保單條款及條件；
2)	 投保人是否知道有關事實；
3)             預期投保人披露有關事實是否合理。
投訴委員會會仔細考慮預期受保人披露某項被保險公司視為重要事實的資料，是否對受保人公平和合理。如果沒有具體及客觀的證據，證明某種在保單生效前已出現的常見醫療狀況／症狀會如何影響保險公司的承保決定，投訴委員會相信保險公司純粹以受保人沒有披露該醫療狀況／症狀屬重要事實，繼而拒絕賠償並不公平和合理。"

He was readmitted around a month later to receive nephroureterectomy. He was diagnosed as suffering from left renal papillary transitional cell carcinoma (TTC). As papillary TTC means that the cancer was not carcinoma in-situ, the insured then submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for “cancer”.The insurer indicated that there was no uncontrolled growth of abnormal cancer cells. It therefore declined the insured’s critical illness claim on the grounds that his condition did not fulfill the policy definition of “cancer”. 
",受保人入住私家醫院進行尿路造影電腦掃描檢查及左腎盂腫瘤活檢，約一個月後再度入院接受腎臟切除手術，被診斷患上左腎乳頭狀移行細胞癌。由於乳頭狀移行細胞癌並不屬原位癌，受保人於是向保險公司遞交「癌症」的危疾索償申請。保險公司指受保人沒有出現不受控的異常癌細胞生長的情況，故拒絕向他發放危疾賠償，原因是他的情況不符合保單內「癌症」定義的要求。,"It is stipulated in the policy provisions of the critical illness policy that “cancer” means “a focal autonomous new growth of abnormal cells which has resulted in the invasion of normal tissues. Such cancer must be positively diagnosed upon the basis of a microscopic examination of fixed tissues, or preparations from the haemic system. Such diagnosis shall be based solely on the accepted criteria of malignancy after a study of the histocytologic architecture of pattern of the suspect tumour, tissue or specimen. Clinical diagnosis does not meet this standard. Cancer of skin, except for malignant melanoma, a noninvasive carcinoma in-situ and CIN lesion of whatever histology, grade or classification shall not be included.” The Complaints Panel learnt from the histopathology report on the 
insured’s left nephroureterectomy specimen that the diagnosis was malignant papillary TCC, grade 2, involving the renal pelvis. No stromal invasion or lymphovascular invasion was identified. Furthermore, the external medical advisor appointed by the insurer concluded the tumour as Ta (non-invasive papillary carcinoma) and was at stage 0a, though it might potentially be invasive at future date.Given that the two pieces of medical evidence showed that the insured’s tumour was non-invasive at the moment when he was diagnosed with papillary TTC, the Complaints Panel was convinced that his condition did not fulfill the policy definition of “cancer”.","有關危疾保單的條款訂明：「癌症」是指「新的不正常細胞在某一焦點範圍內獨立生長，並侵入其他正常的細胞組織。癌病須根據固定細胞組織的微切片檢查或血液系統的細胞檢查作為確實的診斷。被懷疑是腫瘤的組織或樣本必須經過細胞結構及形態分析並符合癌症診斷之條件，一切皆以此為診斷之基礎。臨床診斷的結果並不符合以上的標準。皮膚癌（除惡性黑素瘤外）、原位癌和各級別之子宮頸表層細胞之癌變皆不包括在此保障範圍內。」投訴委員會從受保人切除的左腎樣本組織的病
理學報告得悉，診斷結果為涉及腎盂的第二級惡性乳頭狀移行細胞癌，未有發現間質浸潤或淋巴管浸潤。此外，保險公司委任的外部醫療顧問斷定有關腫瘤屬 Ta 等級（非浸潤性乳頭狀癌），並處於 0a 階段，儘管它將來可能會具侵入性。鑑於兩份醫學證明均顯示受保人在被確診患上乳頭狀移行細胞癌時，腫瘤並沒有侵入性，投訴委員會因此同意他的情況不符合保單內「癌症」定義的要求。","As such, the Complaints Panel supported the insurer’s decision in declining the critical illness claim for HK$700,000. ","投訴委員會因此支持保險公司的決定，不予作出危疾賠償，涉及金額 700,000 港元。","Most traditional critical illness policies exclude major illnesses at the early stage.

She was diagnosed with right shoulder dislocation and was granted sick leave for one week. She subsequently consulted a general practitioner a week later for residual shoulder pain and swelling. A further sick leave of 25 days was granted. She then submitted an accident claim to the insurer for temporary disability benefit.Given that the attending physician indicated in the claim form that the insured’s previous dislocation might have contributed to the current accident and/or lengthen the disability, the insurer declined her accident claim on the grounds that her condition did not conform with the policy definition of “accidental bodily injury”.",受保人上瑜伽班時不慎滑倒導致肩膀受傷，被送到公立醫院急症室，診斷結果為右肩關節脫位，獲發一星期病假。一星期後，她的右肩仍有疼痛及腫脹，遂向私家醫生求診，再獲發25天病假。受保人其後就「暫時性傷殘」保障向保險公司申請意外索償。鑑於主診醫生於索償表格上指出受保人過去的關節脫位可能促成是次意外及／或延長傷殘時間，保險公司因此認為受保人的情況不符合保單內「意外受傷」定義的要求，不予作出意外賠償。,"It is stipulated in the contract provisions of the personal accident policy that “…the insurer will pay a benefit to the insured while the insured suffered disablement, hospitalization or medical treatment resulting directly and independently of all other causes, from accidental bodily injury…” and “accidental bodily injury” means “an injury effected directly and independently of all other causes by accident as evidenced by a visible bruise or wound on the body…”The Complaints Panel noted from the medical records that the insured had sustained right shoulder dislocation six times in the past seven years (including the current one). Three incidents occurred during yoga class and the previous one occurred two years ago. Surgical stabilization was suggested at that time but the insured refused.Since the insured had not performed any surgical stabilization to her right shoulder as suggested by the doctors, she had never fully recovered from recurrent right shoulder dislocation condition.

The complainant reported the incident to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) and the management office. FEHD carried out aninvestigation around two weeks later and water seepage was found at the bedroom ceilings of the insured premises with moisture content exceeding 35%. The result of flow meter test regarding the fresh water supply pipes at the upper flat was negative. Water dripping was also detected from the flush water supply pipe in the guest bathroom of the upper flat. The complainant then filed a claim to the insurer for the repair works of the damaged ceiling. Given that the cause of water damage to the insured premises was due to water seepage of flush water gate valve at the upper flat, the insurer considered that the claim did not fall within the coverage of the aforesaid extra perils extension. Furthermore, as the entire insured premises was under renovation by the complainant two years prior to the incident, the claimed ceiling painting should be deemed as an improvement work rather than the original landlord’s fixtures and fittings. As such, the claim fell outside the scope of the fire policy.",投訴人投購了火險保單，保障因火災、雷電或家用鍋爐或家用氣體燃料爆炸而導致建築物（包括發展商固定裝置及設備）的損失或損毀，並加入《水箱、輸水裝置及水管》附加險，延伸保障至水箱、輸水裝置及水管爆裂或滿溢而直接造成的損毀。投訴人發現受保單位的睡房天花滴水，於是通知食物環境衞生署（食環署）及管理處，食環署約兩星期後派人到受保單位進行調查，發現睡房天花有滲水情況，濕度水平超過35%，而上層單位的食水供水喉管的流量錶測試結果為負數，在該單位客厠的鹹水喉管則發現有滴水。投訴人隨後就受損天花的維修費用向保險公司提交索償申請。鑑於受保單位的損毀是因上層單位的鹹水閘掣滲水所致，保險公司因此認為投訴人的索償不符合有關附加險的保障範圍。此外，由於投訴人於是次事件發生兩年前曾為整個受保單位進行裝修工程，因此申索的天花油漆應被視為家居裝修改良部分，而非發展商固定裝置及設備，有關索償因此超出了火險保單的保障範圍。,"The extra perils extension (Water Tanks, Apparatus & Pipes) provides coverage to damage directly caused by bursting or overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes but excluding (i) the first HK$3,000 of each and every loss… (ii) damage to water tanks apparatus or pipes; and (iii) damage caused by water discharged or leaking from any installation of automatic sprinklers. Since ceilings are part of the fabric of the buildings, they are generally considered as building items, regardless whether or not improvement works have been carried out to them.

The insurer refused to honour the claim as the window frame and hinges were regarded as original building items which were not covered by the household policy while the two air-conditioners belonged to contents in open area which fell within the policy exclusion.","投訴人因受保單位外的鹹水管爆裂導致客廳的分體式冷氣機、主人房的窗口式冷氣機、窗框和窗鉸受損而向保險公司提出家居索償，屋苑管業處其後安排承辦商維修爆裂的喉管。由於窗框和窗鉸屬樓宇結構項目，不在家居保單的保障範圍內；而兩台冷氣機則屬存放在露天地方的物品，為保單的
不保事項，保險公司因此拒絕賠償。","It is stated in the policy provisions that “contents shall exclude any part of the structure or ceilings of the insured premises, wall papers and the like” while the policy exclusion stipulates that “the insurer shall not be liable in respect of loss of or damage to contents on roof or in open area…” The Complaints Panel agreed that the window frame and hinges were not household contents and should be regarded as part of the building structure which was specifically excluded under the policy. Also, since the air compressor of the split-type air-conditioner was mounted on the external wall of the insured premises, the Complaints Panel concurred that it belonged to contents in open area. On the other hand, the Complaints Panel also noted that the building management incident report did not mention or record damage to any window-type air-conditioner in the incident. As such, there was not sufficient evidence to support that the window-type air-conditioner was damaged by the flush water leakage.",有關保單條款訂明：「家居物品不包括受保單位樓宇結構的任何一部分或天花、牆紙或其他類似的物件」，而「不保事項」條款則訂明：「保險公司一概不會負責存放在露天或天台上的物品……的遺失或損毀。」投訴委員會同意窗框和窗鉸不是家居物品，而是樓宇結構的一部分，故不屬於保單的保障範圍。此外，由於分體式冷氣機的散熱器安裝於受保單位的外牆，投訴委員會因此同意它屬存放在露天地方的物品。另一方面，投訴委員會留意到管業處的報告並沒有提及或紀錄有窗口式冷氣機在事件中受損，因此認為現時沒有足夠證據證明該窗口式冷氣機因鹹水滲漏而受損。,"The Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer’s decision to decline the complainant’s claim amounting to around HK$20,000 for the two air-conditioners, window frame and hinges was appropriate and in accordance with the policy exclusions.","投訴委員會同意保險公司乃根據保單內的不保事項條款而不予就兩部冷氣機、窗框和窗鉸受損作出賠償，並裁定有關決定合理，涉及的金額約 20,000 港元。","All insurance contracts contain an insuring clause which specifies the types, causes and nature of loss covered by the policy. There is also an “exclusion” section which lists all losses, perils, situations, conditions or circumstances that are excluded from the policy coverage.

Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, Spain declared a state of emergency and a partial lockdown for 15 days commencing 15 March 2020 while the airlines refused to allow passengers from Spain to enter Turkey and board the aircraft starting from the same day. Under such situation, the tour decided to cut short the journey and the couple had to purchase flight tickets from another airline to early return to Hong Kong directly from Lisbon via Dubai and Kuala Lumpur on 16 March 2020. They finally arrived Hong Kong on 17 March 2020. After returned to Hong Kong, the couple filed a claim to the insurer for the additional airfares incurred under the Journey Interruption (Curtailment Expenses) benefit of the travel insurance policy. The insurer indicated that the Department of Health (DoH) of HKSAR had issued a press release on 6 March 2020 announcing that `the transmission of Covid-19 virus has been increasing around the world and members of the public are advised to consider delaying all non-essential travel outside Hong Kong.’ Given that the couple commenced their trip after the announcement from DoH, the insurer declined the travel claim based on the policy exclusion which excludes loss caused as a result of the failure of the insured person to take reasonable precautions to avoid a claim.",一對夫婦參加 2020 年 3 月出發的 11 天葡萄牙和西班牙旅行團，他們原定於 2020 年 3 月 18 日乘搭由里斯本經伊斯坦堡的航班返港。由於 2019 冠狀病毒病疫情爆發，西班牙宣布自 2020 年 3 月 15 日開始實施為期 15 天的緊急狀態和局部封鎖，航空公司則於同日開始拒絕讓乘客從西班牙進入土耳其及登機。在這情況下，旅行團遂決定縮短行程，投訴人夫婦於是向另一家航空公司購買機票，於 2020 年 3 月 16 日直接從里斯本出發，經杜拜及吉隆坡提早返港，最終於2020 年 3 月 17 日抵港。他們隨後就額外的機票費用向保險公司提出「旅程中斷」保障的索償申請。保險公司表示，香港特區政府衛生署曾於 2020 年 3 月 6 日發新聞公報，指「2019 冠狀病毒病的疫情正在全球各地迅速蔓延，建議市民應考慮延遲所有非必要的外遊計劃。」由於投訴人夫婦的旅程是於衛生署發出有關新聞公報後才出發，保險公司遂根據保單內「不予承保因受保人沒有作出合理的預防以防止索賠出現」的不保事項條款而拒絕賠償。,"It is stated in the policy provisions of the Journey Interruption (Curtailment Expenses) section that “the insurer shall reimburse the insured person… for the amount of travel fare and/or accommodation expenses forfeited and/or additional travel ticket and/or accommodation expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred after the commencement of the insured journey where the insured person has to terminate and cut short the insured journey and return to Hong Kong as a result of… epidemic at the planned destination which prevents the insured person from continuing with his/her scheduled insured journey.” As stipulated in the ”General Exclusions Applicable to All Sections”, “the insurer will not pay… for loss, injury, damage or liability suffered and/or sustained by or arising directly or indirectly as a result of or in connection with… any failure by the insured person to take reasonable precautions to avoid a claim under the insurance following the warning of… epidemic.” ",有關旅遊保單內「旅程中斷（提早結束旅程）」保障的條款訂明：「若受保人在受保旅程期間……在未能預料的情況下，目的地突然……廣泛性爆發傳染病，以致受保人不能繼續原定的受保旅程，並必須結束及縮短受保旅程及返回香港，保險公司將……賠償受保人不能退回及未享用的旅費及／或住宿費用及／或額外合理及／或實際的交通及／或住宿費用」；另「適用於所有保障項目的主要不保項目」訂明：「保險公司不會賠償任何保單內直接或間接因……在預先警告會爆發……傳染病的情況下，受保人沒有作出合理的預防以防止索償的出現。」,"The case was referred to three Honorary Secretaries.

Upon physical examination, there was no mass and no tenderness noted. She also attended once in March 2019 for epigastric pain with nausea. Medications were given.The insurer insisted that the non-disclosed information would have affected its underwriting decision. Should such medical history be disclosed, it would not have issued the policy at its original terms and conditions. It proposed to offer Lucy a continuous hospital coverage with exclusion imposed for gastritis and both breasts. As Lucy did not accept the offer, the insurer declined the hospitalization claim and rescinded the policy.",根據政府診所的紀錄，盧女士於2017年12月因右乳房疼痛求診，並觸診右乳房有腫塊約一星期；經檢查後未有發現腫塊，也無壓痛。此外，她於2019年3月因上腹痛及噁心求診，獲發藥物治療。保險公司指出沒有披露的資料會影響其承保決定假如盧女士於投保時披露有關資料，該公司便不會按其原來的條款和條件繕發有關保單。保險公司其後向盧女士提出維持住院保單繼續生效的建議，但必須於保單內附加豁免保障胃炎和雙側乳房的條款。由於盧女士拒絕接受有關建議，保險公司遂不予作出住院賠償，並撤銷保單。,"The case was referred to three Honorary Secretaries for comments. All of them believed that the extra exclusions imposed by the insurer was not reasonable. Furthermore, they considered that there was no clear evidence of material non-disclosure in the case. As regards Lucy’s right breast pain, the Honorary Secretaries noted that she had given birth to a baby in July 2017. She consulted the government clinic in December 2017 for right breast pain but no mass was noted upon physical examination. She was then discharged without treatment or follow up plan. Same for her gastritis, she only attended a one-off consultation and no follow up was required. The attending physician also documented that her symptoms almost subsided at the time of consultation.

The Complaints Panel had reservation to conclude that Covid-19 was a known or existing circumstance when Stephen took out the travel policy given that the pandemic situation was not very prominent in Europe at the prevailing time.On the other hand, the Complaints Panel noticed that WHO had declared Covid-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 and the Security Bureau of the HKSAR government issued the Red Outbound Travel Alert on the Schengen Area in Europe including France on 13 March 2020 in view of the outbreak of Covid-19 in Europe. The Complaints Panel believed that these two warnings were more widely accepted than PHEIC declaration by WHO on 30 January 2020. As there were only 12 confirmed Covid-19 cases in France when the policy was issued, the Complaints Panel was not convinced that Stephen was able to foresee the restrictive measures which would be implemented by the French government when he began his trip. It also casted doubt on whether the situation should be regarded as a “known circumstance”","保單內「已知事項及狀況」不保事項條款訂明：「本保單不會保障於生效日期前或已宣布會發生的任何情況；或任何投保前已存在的傷疾」。投訴委員會從世衛 2020 年 2 月 21 日發布的《2019 冠狀病毒病情況報告》中注意到，法國當時有 12 宗確診衛生事件」聲明更為廣泛接受。由於涉案保單繕發時法國只有 12 宗確診個案，因此投訴委員會不相信冼先生在旅程出發時能夠預測到法國政府將會實施限制措施，並對有關情況是否應被視為「已知狀況」存疑。
","The Complaints Panel resolved to rule in favour of Stephen and awarded him the “Interruption of Trip” benefit amounting to about HK$10,500. ","投訴委員會裁定冼先生得直，可獲約 10,500港元的「行程中斷」保障賠償。","Most travel insurance policies provide coverage for trip curtailment or interruption if the insured has to early return to Hong Kong due to an insured peril. However, the policies usually contain an exclusion clause to exclude loss arising from events which have already existed or can be expected to happen when the insurance is purchased.

She was diagnosed with axillary hyperhidrosis.

Furthermore, since there was no evidence indicating that microwave ablation is an aesthetic treatment and Jessica was advised by her attending physician to receive the aforesaid treatment for her condition of hyperhidrosis, the Complaints Panel did not agree with the Insurer that the surgery was for cosmetic purpose.", 有關保單條款訂明：「外科醫生費將賠償受保人在住院期間，或在為日症病人提供醫療服務的設備下，主診外科醫生為其進行手術所收取的合資格費用……本保障將按手術表所列相關手術的分類及該手術本身所屬分類作賠償……若需進行的手術並無列於手術表內，保險公司可按政府刊登的憲報或其他相關出版物或資料，包括但不限於在進行該手術的所在地，其政府、相關監管機構及醫學組織認可的收費表，合理地決定該手術的分類。」由於保單條文並沒有列明「手術」或「外科手術」的定義，而投訴委員會得悉微波消融術已獲美國食品藥物管理局認可，是一種以非侵入性方法透過微波能量永久破壞腋下的汗腺組織，故此認為微波消融術應被視為可於門診進行的外科手術。此外，由於沒有證據顯示微波消融是一種美容治療，而簡女士是在其主診醫生建議下就多汗症接受有關治療，投訴委員會因此不同意保險公司指有關手術是美容治療。 ,"The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of Jessica and awarded her the outpatient expenses incurred for microwave ablation amounting to around HK$13,800.","投訴委員會裁定簡女士得直，保險公司需向她賠付進行微波消融術的費用，涉及金額約13,800 港元。","Insurance contracts usually list out the definitions of all the terms

He consulted a cardiologist and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed abnormal T wave inversion.

The insurer explained that Joe’s admission was predominantly for diagnostic scanning purpose. As the admission was scheduled 14 days after the date of consultation, there was no evidence to support the medical necessity to have those investigations performed on an inpatient basis instead of in an outpatient setting. Joe disagreed with the insurer’s decision. He submitted a letter from his doctor who confirmed that he complained of chest pain with abnormal ECG. As the clinical picture fulfilled the classical criteria of acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina subtype), admission was a traditional approach which served for close monitoring. However, the insurer maintained its claim decision.","金先生因胸痛及心悸持續兩天向心臟專科醫生求診，心電圖顯示 T 波倒置異常。兩週後，他入住私家醫院接受超聲心動圖、動態心電圖、電腦斷層掃描、X 光等檢查，最終診斷結果為心絞痛。保險公司僅就「先進影像診斷檢查保障」向金先生作出 6,000 港元的電腦斷層掃描費用賠償，但卻拒絕支付其餘的住院費用。保險公司表示，金先生的住院主要是為了進行影像掃描，加上他的入院安排在求診日的 14 天之後，因此沒有證據支持他入院接受檢查是有醫療必要性，而有關檢查不可在門診進行。金先生不同意保險公司的理賠決定，向保險公司提交主診醫生的信函，函中指出金先生因胸部不適及心電圖異常求診；由於臨床表現符合急性冠狀動脈綜合症（不穩定型心絞痛亞型）的診斷標準，安排入院作密切監察乃屬穩妥的做法。然而，保險公司維持原來的拒賠決定。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions that “medically necessary services” mean “medical or health care services which are necessary for the treatment of an illness, sickness, disease or injury and which are: (a) consistent with the diagnosis and customary medical treatment for medical condition; and (b) in accordance with good and prudent medical practice… (d) performed in the least costly setting for treatment of a covered service”. The policy also contains an exclusion which excludes hospital confinement primarily for diagnostic scanning (save and except advanced diagnostic image), x-ray examinations or physical therapy that can be provided in an outpatient or day hospital setting. Based on the information available, the Complaints Panel noted that Joe mainly received diagnostic examination during his confinement.

He was admitted to a hospital for abdominal pain, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity 16 months later. During claims investigation, the insurer discovered that Elton had been referred to psychiatric evaluation due to focusing and learning problem as reported by his parents and teachers when he was eight. He was provisionally diagnosed to have dyslexia. He was first confirmed to have obesity when he was 13 with BMI 34.8. His body weight and height were 117kg and 173cm respectively when he attended the pre-employment body check-up at age 21.However, Elton did not disclose the above medical information in the application form. It was also stated in the application form that his weight and height were 86kg and 180cm respectively, which were significantly different from the weight and height as stated in his pre-employment check up 14 months ago. When being asked in the application form if he had any weight loss for 5kg in the past 12 months, Elton answered “no”.
As the non-disclosed information was material and would have affected its underwriting decision, the insurer declined Elton’s hospitalization claim.",歐先生在 22 歲時投購了住院保單。16 個月後，他因腹痛、糖尿病、高血壓及肥胖入院。在審理索償期間，保險公司得悉歐先生在八歲時因父母和老師表示他有注意力和學習問題而被轉介至精神科作評估，臨時診斷為閱讀障礙。他在13 歲時首次被確診患上肥胖症，身體質量指數為 34.8；於 21 歲接受入職體檢時，體重和身高分別為 117 公斤和 173厘米。然而，歐先生並沒有在投保申請書上披露有關資料，他在投保申請書上填報體重和身高分別為 86 公斤和 180 厘米，與他 14 個月前進行的職前檢查記錄的體重和身高明顯有差異。當在投保申請書被問及在過去 12 個月內體重有否減少超過五公斤時，歐先生回答「否」。由於沒有披露的資料屬重要事實 ，足以影響保險公司的承保決定，保險公司因此拒絕了歐先生的住院索償申請。,"The Complaints Panel learnt that Elton’s mother had effected a hospital and surgical policy for him when he was three. The servicing agent approached Elton when he was 22 and introduced him a new product with better and wider cover to replace his old policy. Elton accepted and signed the application form for the new policy while the agent completed the other information in the application form for him.Other than the obesity problem, the Complaints Panel believed that Elton’s dyslexia and treatment for focusing skills were too remote which occurred quite a long time ago. It was not convinced that such information was material which would have affected the insurer’s underwriting decision.Given that Elton has had obesity problem since childhood with  noobviousimprovement, the Complaints Panel doubted very much if the weight and height stated in the application form were accurate as it was not practicable for him to grow 7cm taller and lose 31kg in 14 months. Having fully considered Elton’s weight, height and body size, the Complaints Panel viewed that the servicing agent, having seen Elton in person, should be duly aware that he was severely overweight and his policy application might probably not be accepted.",投訴委員會得悉歐先生的母親在他三歲時為他投購了附有住院和手術保障的保單。保險代理在歐先生 22 歲時，向他推介保障範圍更全面及廣泛的新產品，以取代他的舊保單。歐先生接受有關建議，並簽署了新保單的投保申請書，而保險代理則為他填寫投保申請書內的其他資料。除了肥胖問題外，投訴委員會認為歐先生的閱讀障礙和接受專注力的治療在很久之前已經發生，故未能令投訴委員會信服有關資料為重要事實，會影響保險公司的承保決定。鑑於歐先生自小便有肥胖問題，且沒有明顯改善，投訴委員會對他在投保申請書上填報關於體重和身高的資料的準確性存疑，因為要在14 個月內長高七厘米及減輕體重 31 公斤實在不大可能。經充分考慮歐先生的體重、身高和體型後，投訴委員會認為保險代理親眼見過歐先生後，理應意識到他嚴重超重，而他的保單申請可能不會被接受。,"As Elton would have reimbursed for his current hospitalization if his old policy was still effective, the Complaints Panel concluded that there were extenuating circumstances which would merit the insurer to consider, on the basis of goodwill, the granting of an ex-gratia payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of his old policy. The insurer agreed to reverse its decision and admit Elton’s hospitalization claim of around HK$29,000 under the new policy.

1. a material fact which would influence a prudent underwriter in 
accepting or declining a risk or in fixing the premium or terms and 
conditions of the contract; 
2. a fact within the knowledge of the applicant; and
3. a fact which the applicant could reasonably be expected to disclose.

2)投保人是否知道有關事實；
3)預期投保人披露有關事實是否合理。

She was suggested to continue psychotherapy for her post-traumatic stress disorder and adjustment difficulty. Teresa’s attending doctor also confirmed that the part of brain injured most in her head trauma was the left frontal lobe, which entailed cognitive impairment. She would not have demonstrated such a good recovery without the appropriate treatment for the cognitive impairment. After engaging the clinical psychologist in the treatment, Teresa had showed significant improvement in cognitive function which in turn was conductive to the recovery of other disabilities. Based on the above, the Complaints Panel believed that there was an urgent medical need for Teresa to receive cognitive training and the result was satisfactory and conductive to the recovery of her other disabilities. As her cognitive impairment was caused by severe head injury rather than resulted from mental, behavioural, psychiatric or psychological disorder, the Complaints Panel considered that the aforesaid policy exclusion should not be applicable in her case.","保單不保事項條款訂明：「本保單不承保任何直接或間接，全部或部分由……任何與精神、行為或心理有關的疾病或精神病，包括（但不限於）焦慮、厭食、抑鬱、緊張、疲勞或由身體疾病引致的精神病併發症、認知障礙……造成之住院、治療、手術或其他收費。」投訴委員會從認知評估報告中得悉，與病前狀態相比，杜女士被發現有認知能力下降及情緒變化，獲建議繼續對她的創傷後壓力症候群及適應困難進行心理治療。杜女士的主診醫生也證實，她在是次頭部外傷中腦部受創傷最嚴重的部位是左額葉，故導致她出現認知障礙。如果沒有適當的認知障礙治療，她不會有如此良好的康復進度，在接受臨床心理學家的治療後，杜女士的認知功能有了顯著改善，這反過來有助她其他傷患的康復。綜合上述各項，投訴委員會認為杜女士有急切醫療需要接受認知訓練，而結果令人滿意，更對她其他傷患的康復進度有利。由於她的認知障礙是因為頭部嚴重受傷導致，而非由精神、行為、心理有關的疾病或精神病引起，投訴委員會因此認為有關保單不保事項條款不適用於她的個案。

He was not required to declare any health information in the policy application form. One year later, he suffered from shortness of breath and was admitted to a private hospital. The diagnoses were pericardial effusion, pulmonary embolism, cardiac tamponade, stroke, severe chest infection and nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). He later developed progressive respiratory failure likely due to severe pneumonia and passed away in hospital after being confined for 40 days. The primary cause of his death was chest infection and the contributing factors included NPC, pulmonary embolism and pericardial effusion.During claims investigation, the insurer found that Nick was diagnosed with NPC three years ago and had received concurrent chemotherapy treatment. The insurer thus treated his NPC as a pre-existing condition which was not covered under the policy. Given that the computed tomography pulmonary angiogram showed possibility of lung metastases of cancer and that Nick’s medical conditions of pericardial effusion, pulmonary embolism and stoke diagnosed during his confinement were correlated to or complications of his NPC or lung metastases of cancer, the insurer refused to honour the hospitalization claim on the grounds of “pre-existing condition” exclusion. Nick’s wife appealed against the claim decision and provided various medical reports from Nick’s attending physicians to support the case. One doctor confirmed that Nick suffered from bilateral pleural effusion and massive pericardial effusion. Epstein-Barr encoding region test was negative which could not substantiate the diagnosis of metastatic NPC. He later developed pulmonary embolism, minor stroke and severe pneumonia, all of these conditions were not regarded as a direct cause of his NPC. Another doctor indicated that the aetiology of pulmonary embolism in Nick’s case could be multifactorial, e.g. related to sepsis or underlying hereditary coagulopathy. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was directly related to his NPC history.The insurer maintained its decision after having sought a second opinion from an oncology specialist who commented: (a) Nick had uncontrolled NPC recurrence with continuous treatment; (b) the direct cause of Nick’s death was pneumonia which is a common complication of either direct disease involvement of the lung or airway, or as a result of treatment, either chemotherapy or radiography, which were both given during his latest confinement.","
魏先生向保險公司投購醫療保單，他毋須在投保申請書上申報任何病歷資料。一年後，他因呼吸急促入住私家醫院，被確診患上心包膜積水、肺栓塞、心包填塞、中風、嚴重胸部感染及鼻咽癌。其後，魏先生可能因為感染嚴重肺炎而引致漸進性呼吸衰竭，並在住院 40 天後在醫院去世，主要死因為胸部感染，而其他促成因素包括鼻咽癌、肺栓塞和心包膜積水。在調查索償期間，保險公司得悉魏先生在三年前被確診患上鼻咽癌，接受同步化療，保險公司因此認為他的鼻咽癌為投保前已存在疾病，屬保單的不保事項。由於肺動脈電腦斷層掃描顯示轉移性肺癌的可能性，而魏先生於住院期間被診斷患上的心包膜積水、肺栓塞和中風與他的鼻咽癌或轉移性肺癌相關或為相關病況的併發症，保險公司遂以「已存在的情況」為理由，不予作出住院賠償。魏先生的妻子對索賠決定提出上訴，並提供了魏先生的主診醫生們多份醫療報告作為支持文件。其中一位醫生證實魏先生患有雙側胸腔積液和大量心包膜積水，由於巴爾病毒編碼測試呈陰性，故不能確定轉移性鼻咽癌的診斷；他後來罹患肺栓塞、輕微中風和重症肺炎，所有病況均不是因鼻咽癌直接導致。另一位醫生則表示，魏先生的肺栓塞成因可能涉及多項因素，例如與敗血症或潛在遺傳性凝血病有關，現時沒有足夠證據證明他的肺栓塞與其鼻咽癌病史有直接關係。保險公司向腫瘤科專家尋求第二意見後，決定維持原來決定，該專家指：(1)魏先生在持續治療中出現不受控的鼻咽癌復發；(2)導致魏先生死亡的直接原因為肺炎，屬肺部或氣管直接受感染的常見併發症，或是他最近住院進行的化療或放射性治療的結果。","It is stated in the policy provisions that “pre-existing condition” means “any medical condition which during the five years preceding the policy date: (1) has been diagnosed; or (2) for which the insured has received medication, advice or treatment; or (3) which the insured reasonably has known about based on the insurer’s appointed medical doctor’s opinion; or (4) for which the insured has experienced symptoms even if the insured has not consulted a medical practitioner.” Furthermore, there is a clause stipulating that “no benefit will be payable for treatment of any pre-existing condition including associated medical conditions… The insurer will assess a medical condition associated with a preexisting condition as a pre-existing condition. The insurer will determine that a medical condition is associated with a preexisting condition when this pre-existing condition is recognized either by the insured’s treating doctor and the insurer’s appointed medical doctor in the concerned medical area, as a risk factor, or if it is directly or indirectly related to such medical condition…”The Complaints Panel agreed that Nick’s NPC was a pre-existing condition. However, having duly studied the opinions given by Nick’s attending physicians, there was no concrete evidence to prove beyond doubt that his pulmonary embolism and cardiac tamponade were complications of his NPC. Given that Nick’s attending doctors should be in a better position to comment on his condition, the Complaints Panel tended to rely more on their opinions and was thus convinced that Nick’s aforesaid medical conditions were not resulted from his NPC.","有關醫療保單的條款訂明：「已存在的情況」是指「任何病症於保單日期之前五年：(1) 已被確診；(2)受保人已服食藥物、接受意見或治療；(3)根據保險公司委任的醫生的意見，受保人理應已知悉；或(4)即使受保人沒有向醫生診療，受保人已出現有關症狀」。此外，保單另有條款訂明：「保險公司將不承保任何已存在的情況（包括相關的病症）的治療……保險公司會將與已存在的情況相關的病症，視作已存在的情況，若受保人的主診醫生及保險公司委任有關醫療範疇的醫生認定有關已存在的情況屬風險因素或直接或間接與該病症有關，保險公司將會確定有關病症與已存在的情況有關……」投訴委員會同意魏先生的鼻咽癌屬已存在的情況，然而，經仔細審閱魏先生主診醫生們的意見後，認為沒有具體證據可以毫無疑點地證明他的肺栓塞和心包填塞是鼻咽癌的併發症。由於魏先生的主診醫生們應該更適合就魏先生的病情提出意見，投訴委員會因此傾向依賴他們的意見，相信魏先生的相關病況並非由他的鼻咽癌所導致的。

He then received cryosurgery to remove the viral warts at Dr Ma’s clinic. The total medical expenses incurred was HK$70,000, comprising of HK$67,000 surgeon’s fee and HK$3,000 operating theatre fee. According to the Schedule of Surgical Operations under the policy, the surgical class for “cauterization of skin lesion with electricity or cryosurgery” was minor. The insurer also made reference to the list of private services in Hospital Authority (HA) which stated that “cauterization of warts on skin” was classified as Minor I operation and the related fees (including surgeon fee, administration of anaesthetics, medicines used in operation and operating theatre expenses) ranged from HK$6,070 to HK$12,750. Having further reviewed its internal claims statistics and the survey conducted by the industry, the insurer considered that the fees charged by Dr Ma had exceeded the usual charges level for similar treatment. It therefore applied the reasonable and customary (R&C) charges clause in Fred’s case and allowed an admissible amount of HK$25,500. An amount of HK$10,500 was settled after deducting an annual deductible amount of HK$15,000. Fred subsequently provided the insurer with a letter from Dr Ma to appeal against its decision. Dr Ma indicated that there were about 350 viral warts over all the affected regions and it took about 2.5 hours to finish the surgical procedure. The fee was charged according to the number and the depth of the warts, as well as the operation duration. However, the insurer maintained its claim decision.","樊先生兩個月前發現前額、雙眼眶周圍、鼻子、臉頰、下巴、下頜骨和頸部出現多發性病毒疣，遂向馬醫生求診，並於其診所接受冷凍手術以切除病毒疣，總費用為 70,000 港元，當中 67,000 港元屬外科醫生費用，3,000 港元則為手術室費用。根據有關保單的「外科手術表」顯示，「治療皮膚病變的電灼或冷凍術」的手術類別為小型手術。保險公司參考了醫院管理局（醫管局）有關私家醫療服務項目的收費，其中列明「皮膚疣電灼治療」屬於第一類小型手術，相關費用（包括：外科醫生費、麻醉師費、手術中使用的藥物及手術室費用）介乎 6,070 港元至 12,750 港元。保險公司進一步檢視其內部索償統計及保險業界的醫療費調查統計後，認為馬醫生的收費已超出同類治療的一般收費範圍的水平，故在樊先生的索償個案引用「合理和慣常收費」條款，同意作出 25,500 港元的賠償。保險公司最終在扣除 15,000 港元的年度自負額後，向樊先生賠償 10,500 港元。 樊先生其後向保險公司上訴，並轉交了馬醫生的信函。馬醫生表示，樊先生於受感染的部位有約 350 粒疣，手術需約兩個半小時才完成；他的收費乃根據疣的數量和深度，以及手術所需的時間。然而，保險公司維持其原來的索賠決定。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions that “R&C charges” mean “charges for treatment, procedure, supplies or other medical services which do not exceed the general level of charges at the location of similar treatment, procedure, supplies or other medical services to individuals of the same sex and comparable age, for a similar disease or injury. The insurer will base the calculation of R&C charges on a combination of the following (if applicable): (a) the gazette issued by the Hong Kong government which sets out the fees for the private patient services in public hospitals in Hong Kong; (b) statistical information provided by local health authoritative body and information collected from medical specialists and surgeons practicing in the country or area where the treatment is received; (c) industrial medical fee survey; (d) the insurer’s internal claims statistics and/or global experience; and (e) the extent or level of benefit insured.” The Complaints Panel noted that the insurer’s offer of HK$25,500 was already a double of the top end of the range of HA’s reference for similar operation. Having further studied the insurer’s internal records for claims involving warts removal, as well as the severity and complexity of the procedure, the Complaints Panel concurred that the insurer’s claim assessment was fair and appropriate and in accordance with the terms and conditions as stipulated in the policy. ","保單條款訂明：「合理及慣常收費」是指「治療、手術、供應物或其他醫療服務的收費，但該收費不超過為同性別及相約年齡的人士提供有關類似的治療、手術、供應物或其他醫療服務的地區的一般收費水平。保險公司會按以下（如適用）的一個組合來計算合理及慣常收費：(a) 由香港政府憲報就香港公立醫院為私家病人提供醫療服務所定的收費；(b) 由當地衛生主管機構提供的統計資料及向在接受該治療的國家或地區的醫療專家及外科醫生收集的資料；(c) 保險業內醫療費調查報告；(d) 保險公司內部索償統計及或保險公司的環球理賠經驗；及 (e) 受保之保險賠償範圍及保障級別。」投訴委員會認為，保險公司提出的 25,500 港元賠償建議已是醫管局就同類手術的參考收費的範圍上限的兩倍。經進一步審閱保險公司有關病毒疣切除的內部索賠紀錄，以及手術的嚴重性及複雜程度，投訴委員會同意保險公司的理賠決定公平和適當，並符合保單所訂的條款及條件。",The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insurer and agreed with its claim offer.,投訴委員會裁定保險公司向樊先生作出的賠償建議合理。,"R&C charges clause aims to prevent potential abuse of overcharging of medical fees and to control costs for the ultimate benefit of the insuring public.

He was found to have serial troponin I rise. He was then admitted to a private hospital one month later for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stenting under the care of Dr Leung. The diagnosis was coronary artery disease. Kelvin submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for “heart attack”. The insurer learnt from the referral letter issued by the public hospital that serial non-ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) and elevated troponin I level were noted. As there was no evidence of new ECG changes indicating myocardial infarction, the insurer declined Kelvin’s claim on the grounds that his condition did not fulfil the policy definition of “heart attack”.",郭先生因急性呼吸困難及胸口痛到公立醫院求診，多次監測後被發現肌鈣蛋白 I 水平升高。一個月後，他按梁醫生建議入住私家醫院，接受經皮冠狀動脈成形術和支架植入，診斷結果為冠心病。郭先生就「心臟病發作」向保險公司提出危疾索償申請。保險公司從公立醫院發出的轉介信中得悉，郭先生的心電圖出現連續缺血性改變，而肌鈣蛋白 I 水平則升高。由於沒有證據顯示新近的心電圖變化出現心肌梗塞形成，保險公司遂以郭先生的情況不符合保單內「心臟病發作」的定義，不予作出危疾賠償。,"It is stipulated in the critical illness policy that “heart attack” means “the death of a portion of heart muscle as a result of inadequate blood supply to the relevant area. The diagnosis must be based on all of the following:
 a history of typical chest pain;
 new ECG changes indicating myocardial infarction; and 
 elevation of cardiac enzymes indicating myocardial damage.”
The Complaints Panel noted from the medical report of Dr Leung that Kelvin’s distal left anterior descending artery had a stenosis of 65% and his ostial left circumflex artery had a blockage closed to 60%. ECG taken at private hospital showed ST-T abnormality with horizontal ST depression. Dr Leung further supplemented that Kelvin’s condition fell into the ambit to which the policy definitions refer, including: chest pain, ECG changes, elevation of cardiac enzymes, narrowing or blockage of one or more coronary arteries resulting in inadequate blood supply to relevant area, etc.The Complaints Panel was not convinced that the information on the 
referral letter which the insurer mainly relied on to decline the critical illness claim was sufficient to make a fair assessment of the case. As Dr Leung, being Kelvin’s attending doctor, should be in a better position to comment on his condition, the Complaints Panel inclined to adopt Dr Leung’s professional opinions and concurred that Kelvin’s condition met the definition of “heart attack” in the policy.","有關危疾保單訂明：「心臟病發作」是指「由於心臟血液供應不足，導致有關部位的心肌壞死，有關診斷必須以下列所有條件為基礎：

 及
 診斷性心肌酵素含量增加，顯示心肌受損。」
投訴委員會從梁醫生的醫療報告中得悉，郭先生的左前降支遠端狹窄達 65%，而他的左迴旋支開口位置阻塞程度接近 60%；他在私家醫院進行的心電圖顯示 ST-T 段波型異常及 ST 段水平下降。梁醫生進一步補充指，郭先生的病況符合保單「心臟病發作」的定義，包括：胸痛、心電圖改變、心肌酵素上升、一條或以上冠狀動脈狹窄或阻塞導致相關部位供血不足等等。對於保險公司主要依據轉介信內的資料而拒絕危疾索償，投訴委員會並不認為有關資料足以對此個案作出公正的評估。由於梁醫生是郭先生的主診醫生，他應該更清楚郭先生的病情，因此投訴委員會傾向倚重梁醫生的專業意見，遂同意郭先生的情況符合保單「心臟病發作」的定義。

fraction lower than average while electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus tachycardia and T wave change. He was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, cardiac function Grade 4, bilateral pleural effusion, bronchial asthma and lung nodules. He then submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for “cardiomyopathy”.The insurer noted that the ECG showed only mild abnormality which would not lead to permanent Grade 4 cardiac function. As there was no evidence showing that Simon had abnormal ventricular function resulting in significant physical impairment nor was symptomatic at rest despite the use of medicine and dietary adjustment, the Insurer considered that his condition failed to fulfill Class 4 on New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of cardiac impairment and declined the critical illness claim.",施先生因活動時出現胸悶、氣促及咳嗽而入住內地一家醫院。超聲心動圖顯示中度二尖瓣關閉不全及輕微肺動脈高壓，左心室射出率低於平均水平，而心電圖則顯示竇性心動過速和 T 波改變。他被診斷患上擴張型心肌病，屬心肌損害第四級、雙側胸腔積液、支氣管哮喘和肺結節。他其後就「心肌病」向保險公司申請危疾索償。保險公司指施先生的心電圖僅顯示輕微異常，不會導致永久性心肌損害第四級的程度。由於現時沒有證據顯示施先生的心室功能異常導致嚴重心肌受損，並在使用了藥物治療及飲食調節後，在休息時也呈現症狀，保險公司因此認為他的病況未能達到紐約心臟協會所訂的心肌損害級別的第四級程度，遂拒絕向他發放危疾賠償。,"As stipulated in the policy provisions, “cardiomyopathy” is defined as “condition of impaired ventricular function (of variable aetiology) resulting in significant physical impairment of at least Class 4* on the NYHA classification of cardiac impairment. The diagnosis must be made by a specialist. Cardiomyopathy includes dilated, hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Cardiomyopathy caused directly or indirectly, wholly or partly, by coronary artery disease or alcohol or drug abuse is excluded.”
* NYHA Class 4 cardiomyopathy impairment means that the patient is symptomatic at rest despite the use of medicine and dietary 
adjustment, and there is evidence of abnormal ventricular function on physical examination and laboratory studies.The Complaints Panel leant from medical literature that NYHA Class 4 is typically categorized as severe congestive heart failure. Patients with NYHA Class 4 are unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the angina syndrome may be present even at rest. Having duly studied the hospital reports and records, the Complaints Panel was not convinced that there was a 
clear indication that Simon had presented with severe cardiac failure/ impairment symptom even at rest or he was unable to carry on any physical activity. There was also a lack of concrete evidence that his physical impairment had reached the stage specified in NYHA Class 4.

She then submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for “cancer”. During claims investigation, the insurer found that Mable was admitted to a private hospital five months prior to her policy application due to dizziness, vertigo and bilateral hearing blockage. She was suspected to suffer from Meniere’s disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of brain were performed and the results were normal. She consulted her doctors for mild intermittent dizzy spells 10 days after discharged. The doctor referred her to seek opinion from a neurologist to rule out other possible neurological causes.As Mable had not disclosed her suffering from Meniere’s disease and the doctor’s referral to seek a neurologist for further investigation in the application form, the insurer declined her critical illness claim on the grounds of material nondisclosure. Mable appealed to the insurer and submitted various medical reports to support her dizziness was not related to her pancreatic cancer. She emphasized that the investigation of brain was not “advised” by her doctor, but requested by herself as she was cautious about her health. She also took the initiative to request the doctor for a referral letter in case she needed it later. The doctor confirmed in writing that Mable requested for MRI and MRA of brain even though clinically her symptom was highly suggestive of Meniere’s disease. In addition, he advised her to seek opinion from a neurologist if her dizziness persisted or symptom deteriorated. As there was no persistent dizziness, Mable did not seek any subsequent follow up.

stood firm on the claim decision.",麥女士在她的危疾保單生效九個月後被確診患上胰臟癌三期，遂向保險公司提交「癌症」的危疾索償。於調查索償期間，保險公司發現她在投購涉案保單的五個月前曾因頭暈、眩暈及雙耳聽力障礙入住私家醫院，被懷疑患上梅尼爾氏症，而腦部磁力共振檢查及磁力共振血管造影結果則正常。出院 10 天後，麥女士因輕度間歇性頭暈求診，醫生於是轉介她往神經專科醫生尋求意見，以排除其他可能的神經系統疾病的病因。由於麥女士沒有在投保申請書上申報患有梅尼爾氏症及獲醫生轉介至神經專科醫生作進一步檢查的病歷資料，保險公司因此以她未有披露重要事實為理由，不予接納她的索償申請。麥女士向保險公司提出上訴，並提交了多份醫療報告，以證明她的頭暈與胰臟癌無關。另她強調接受腦部檢查並不是醫生的建議，而是因為她緊張自己的身體健康而要求進行。她還主動要求醫生給予推薦信，以備日後需要。主診醫生亦書面確認麥女士要求進行腦部磁力共振檢查及磁力共振血管造影，儘管她的症狀顯示她很大可能是患上梅尼爾氏症；主診醫生又建議麥女士如果頭暈持續或症狀惡化，應向神經專科醫生尋求意見。然而，由於麥女士沒有持續頭暈，故她沒再尋求任何後續跟進。然而，保險公司堅持未有披露的資料對其承保決定有重要影響，故維持原來決定。,"The Complaints Panel looked into the health declaration in the application form and noticed that there was only one question which might deem relevant to the case. The question asked if the applicant has had any medical condition that has required of a surgical operation or procedure… or has been advised to have follow up or follow up investigation by a registered medical doctor within the last seven years, and Mable answered “no”.As Mable actively requested for MRI and MRA examinations, the Complaints Panel was convinced that she had not been “advised” by her doctor to have follow up or follow up investigation. In other words, she had truthfully responded to the aforesaid question in the application form. Given that MR scans revealed no abnormality and the doctor only advised Mable to seek opinion from a neurologist if her symptoms persisted (a conditional suggestion), the Complaints Panel believed that the grounds for the insurer to decline the critical illness claim was not very strong. 
","投訴委員會查看投保申請書內的健康聲明，得知只有一條問題可能與麥女士的情況有關，該問題問及受保人在過去七年曾否因病況而需要進行外科手術或程序……或曾否被建議由註冊醫生覆診或跟進檢驗，麥女士回答「否」。由於磁力共振檢查及磁力共振血管造影乃麥女士主動要求進行，投訴委員會因此同意她沒有獲醫生建議進行跟進檢驗；換言之，她已如實地回答了投保申請書上的有關問題。鑑於磁力共振掃描並沒有發現異常結果，加上主診醫生只建議麥女士若症狀持續可向神經專科醫生尋求意見（屬有條件的建議），投訴委員會因此認為保險公司拒絕麥女士的危疾索償的理由並不充分。

As his previous x-ray of pelvic, sacroiliac joint and spine taken a few years ago showed features suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis and spinous process ligament calcification, the Complaints Panel doubted if the claimed disability was solely and directly caused by the traffic accident, independent of all other causes.",有關保單的條文訂明：「意外」是指「純粹及直接經猛烈、外來及意外力導致身體承受的傷害，並由於該猛烈、外來及意外力導致身體上有可見的瘀傷或傷口，或有內傷跡象，或內外傷兼有。」投訴委員會留意到，戴先生在交通意外後第一次被送往急症室當天並沒有記錄他有重大創傷，他於同日出院；10 天後，他被診斷患上竹節狀脊柱（即強直性脊柱炎的併發症）及第10 節和第 11 節胸椎骨折。由於戴先生幾年前進行的骨盆、骶髂關節和脊柱 X 光顯示有強直性脊柱炎及棘突韌帶鈣化的特徵，投訴委員會對他目前的傷殘是否完全及直接由該交通事故造成、並獨立於其他因素存疑。,"In this connection, the Complaints Panel supported the insurer’s decision in declining David’s claim for the ATPD benefit of HK$1,000,000 since the definition of “accident’ was not fulfilled."," 就此，投訴委員會支持保險公司拒絕戴先生就「意外完全及永久傷殘保障」的索償申請，金額涉及 1,000,000港元，原因是個案不符合保單內「意外」的定義。","In order to ascertain whether or not an injury was caused directly and independently by an accident, the Complaints Panel usually focuses on the nature of the injury and the diagnoses made by the attending doctor. If there is evidence showing that other factors like previous injury or degenerative changes exist which may contribute to the occurrence of the injury, the Complaints Panel will likely support the decision to decline the related claim.",為確定某宗傷患是否由獨立的意外事故直接造成，投訴委員會會考慮傷患的性質及主診醫生的診斷結果。如果有證據顯示有其他因素（如舊患或退化性改變）存在導致傷患發生，投訴委員會一般會支持保險公司拒絕賠償的決定。

The policy was then issued on standard terms. He passed away two years later and the cause of his death was cerebral hemorrhage. Upon claims investigation, the insurer noted that Harry had sought consultations in a hospital in the mainland. Computed tomography (CT) scan report of bilateral kidney done in 2012 revealed multiple cystic changes and Harry was suggested to further conduct a high dose CT scan. As such health information, which would materially affect the underwriting decision of the insurer, was not disclosed in the policy application, the insurer declined to pay the death claim submitted by Harry’s wife. Harry’s wife submitted a letter from a nephrology specialist to appeal against the insurer’s decision. The specialist commented that Harry did not have positive family history of polycystic kidney disease and the CT findings were compatible of solitary simple renal cysts of no clinical significance. As the nephrology specialist was not Harry’s attending doctor for consultation in 2012, the insurer considered that the comments might not reflect the true and complete picture of Harry’s health condition. It therefore maintained its previous claim decision.",夏先生於 2018 年向保險公司投購人壽保單，在投保申請書上申報健康病歷，保險公司遂以標準條款繕發保單。兩年後，夏先生因腦出血逝世。於調查索償期間，保險公司得悉夏先生曾在內地一家醫院求診，2012 年進行的電腦斷層掃描報告顯示雙腎有多處囊性改變，被建議進一步接受高劑量電腦斷層掃描。由於夏先生沒有在投保申請書上披露有關資料，而這些資料對保險公司的核保決定有重大影響，因此保險公司拒絕接納夏先生的妻子提交的死亡索賠申請。夏先生的妻子不滿保險公司的賠償決定提出上訴，並提交了腎內科專科醫生的信函，函中指出夏先生沒有多囊腎病的陽性家族史，而電腦斷層掃描的結果與孤立單純性腎囊腫相符，在臨床上沒有重要性。由於該腎內科專科醫生並非夏先生於 2012 年的主診醫生，保險公司認為該專科醫生的意見或未能反映夏先生當時健康狀況的真實情況及完整性，遂維持原來拒賠的決定。,"Having reviewed all available information, the Complaints Panel understood that Harry’s death was caused by cerebral aneurysm which had association with polycystic kidney. Should Harry declare his multiple cystic changes in kidney in 2012 and the advice for 
a further high dose CT scan at the time of policy application, the insurer’s underwriting decision would have been different as further 
examinations would be requested by the insurer to find out the nature and distribution of the cysts.",經審閱所有資料後，投訴委員會了解到夏先生的死因為腦動脈瘤，與多囊腎病相關。如果夏先生在投保時披露了他在 2012 年的腎臟檢查發現多處囊性變化，以及被建議進一步接受高劑量電腦斷層掃描的資料，保險公司的核保決定必會有所不同，保險公司務必要求夏先生作進一步檢查，以確定囊腫的性質及分佈。,"Given that the non-disclosed medical information was material which would have affected the insurer from making a fair and accurate underwriting decision, the Complaints Panel supported the insurer’s decision in declining the death claim of around HK$700,000 for material non-disclosure."," 鑑於沒有披露的病歷資料屬於重要事實，會影響保險公司作出公平及準確的核保決定，因此投訴委員會支持保險公司以沒有披露重要事實為理由，不予發放身故賠償的決定，涉及金額約 700,000 港元。","Insurance contracts are based on trust. Insurers trust the insureds to give precise and true details of the subject matter to be insured. This is called the principle of “Utmost Good Faith”. The nature of the subject matter of insurance and the circumstances pertaining to it are facts within the knowledge of the insureds. Insurers, on the other hand, are not aware of these facts unless the insureds tell them. The insureds, therefore, should always take care to tell the whole truth. Non-disclosure arises when an applicant for an insurance policy fails to disclose in the application form facts within his/her knowledge.If the non-disclosed fact is a material fact which is within the knowledge of the insured and which the insured could reasonably be expected to disclose, the Complaints Panel will generally support the insurer’s denial of claim for material non-disclosure. This is because the non-disclosure has prejudiced the insurer from making a fair and accurate underwriting assessment.The Complaints Panel reminds all insureds that “if in doubt as to whether a fact is material, it would be advisable to disclose it”.",保險合約建基於信任。保險公司信任投保人會對投保事項提供準確和真實的資料，此之謂「最高誠信原則」。投保事項的性質，以及與之相關的各種狀況，均是投保人認知範圍內的事實，除非投保人主動相告，否則保險公司不會知道，因此投保人有責任交代所有事實。如果投保人在投保時沒有披露已知的事實，則會被視為沒有披露事實。如沒有披露的資料屬投保人認知範圍內，並在合理預期下需要披露的重要事實，投訴委員會一般會支持保險公司以沒有披露重要事實為理由拒絕賠償，因為沒有披露的事實令保險公司無法作出公平及準確的承保決定。投訴委員會提醒所有投保人：如不確定某些事實是否重要，最好還是加以披露為佳。

Whole body positron emission tomography scan and blood test were performed during confinement. The diagnoses were pyrexia of unknown origin and HHV-7 infection. The insurer duly settled her hospitalization claim in accordance with the policy benefits.Ms Fan was further admitted due to fever and bilateral painful groin swelling about four weeks after she was discharged from her first confinement. Excisional right groin lymph node was performed and the diagnoses were acute lymphadenitis and toxoplasmosis infection.The insurer considered that Ms Fan's second admission was a progression of disease related to her first confinement. It thus treated the two claims as the same disability and settled her second claim subject to the same maximum limit.,范女士因發燒數天入住私家醫院，住院期間接受全身正電子電腦斷層掃描檢查及血液檢驗，診斷結果為不明原因導致發熱及人類疱疹病毒 7 型感染。保險公司其後按保單條款悉數作出住院賠償。范女士於出院後約四星期因發燒及雙側腹股溝腫脹和疼痛再次住院，並接受右側腹股溝淋巴結切除手術，診斷結果為急性淋巴腺炎及弓形蟲感染。保險公司認為范女士第二次入院是她第一次住院相關病況的延續，遂以同一傷病處理該兩次住院索償，並以相同的最高賠償額為限，支付了她第二次住院的索賠。,It was noted from the attending physician's medical report that Ms Fan had been hospitalized twice for different infections within two months. The first hospitalization was due to HHV-7 infection whereas the second one was due to acute lymphadenitis secondary to toxoplasmosis infection. The Complaints Panel found that there were inadequate medical grounds to support that the underlying cause of Ms Fan's two hospital confinements were related to each other as fever is a common symptom. The Complaints Panel tended to rely more on the opinions of the attending doctor who was in a better position to comment on Ms Fan's condition and agreed that her second confinement should be considered as a separate disability.,根據主診醫生報告顯示，范女士於兩個月內因不同感染兩度入院，第一次住院乃因人類疱疹病毒 7 型感染，而第二次住院則與弓形蟲感染繼發急性淋巴腺炎有關。由於發燒乃一種常見症狀，投訴委員會認為現有的醫療文件不足以證明范女士兩次住院的根本原因彼此相關。投訴委員會相信范女士的主診醫生應較為合適就范女士的身體狀況作出評論，故傾向倚重主診醫生的意見，同意范女士的第二次住院應被視為另一獨立的傷病。,"The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of Ms Fan and resolved that the insurer should treat her two hospitalization claims separately. The extra reimbursement amount was around HK$16,000.","投訴委員會裁定范女士得直，保險公司需以兩宗傷病分開處理她的兩次住院索償，涉及的額外賠償為 16,000 港元。","Nearly all medical insurance policies have ""same disability"" provision to limit its coverage to recurrent confinements due to disabilities arising from the same cause. In determining whether two or more hospitalizations should be treated as ""same disability"", the Complaints Panel usually relies on the medical reports available and refers to the medical opinions of the attending doctors.",幾乎所有醫療保單均載有「同一傷病」的條款，將保障範圍限制至由同一原因導致的傷病而需反覆住院。在考慮兩次或以上的住院是否屬「同一傷病」時，投訴委員會一般會倚重相關醫療報告，並參考主診醫生的醫療意見。

He was then admitted to a private hospital for two days (first confinement) for computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), echocardiogram, x-ray, etc. The diagnosis was severe coronary artery disease (CAD). He had CAD seven years ago and was found to have moderate to severe stenosis at ostial left anterior descending artery. Six days after discharge, he was re-admitted (second confinement) for cardiac catheterization, intravascular ultrasound and percutaneous coronary intervention.The insurer fully settled Mr Cheng's claim for the second confinement but considered that his first confinement was not medically necessary. Given that the first confinement was primarily for diagnostic scanning which could be provided in an outpatient or day hospital setting and that there was no evidence justifying the medical necessity of performing such tests on an inpatient basis, the insurer only reimbursed the CTCA expenses incurred under the Advanced Diagnostic Imaging benefit (maximum limit HK$6,000) but rejected the rest of the hospital charges incurred.","鄭先生因胸部不適持續一星期向醫生求診，獲安排入住私家醫院兩天接受電腦斷層心臟冠狀動脈血管造影、心臟超聲波及 X 光等檢查（住院一），診斷結果為嚴重冠狀動脈疾病。鄭先生於七年前曾患上冠狀動脈疾病，被發現左前降支開口中度至嚴重狹窄。出院六天後，他再次入院接受心導管檢查、血管內超聲波及冠狀動脈介入治療（俗稱「通波仔手術」）（住院二）。保險公司就「住院二」向鄭先生作出悉數賠償，但認為「住院一」並不是醫療必須的，因為「住院一」主要是為了接受診斷性檢查，可以於門診或以日症方式在醫院進行，而現時亦沒有證據證明鄭先生有醫療必要，須住院進行相關檢查。據此，保險公司僅按「先進影像診斷檢查」保障（賠償上限為 6,000 港元），向鄭先生賠償心臟冠狀動脈血管造影檢查的費用，而不予支付其餘的住院費用。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions that ""medically necessary services"" mean ""medical or health care services which are necessary for the treatment of an illness, sickness, disease or injury and which are: (i) consistent with the diagnosis and customary medical treatment for medical condition; (ii) in accordance with good and prudent medical practice; (iii) not for the convenience of the policyholder, the insured person or the doctor; and (iv) covered service performed at normal and customary charge."" The policy also contains an exclusion which excludes hospital confinement primarily for diagnostic scanning (save and except advanced diagnostic image), x-ray examinations or physical therapy that can be provided in an outpatient or day hospital setting.The Complaints Panel noted that Mr Cheng's attending doctor disagreed that the tests offered to Mr Cheng during his first confinement were not medically necessary and could be done on an outpatient basis. Mr Cheng had suspected acute coronary syndrome at the time of admission and he needed to be observed during CTCA, which itself could induce fatal ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation as he had known CAD. Given that Mr Cheng was first diagnosed with CAD seven years ago, taking into consideration his past CAD history and the attending doctor's professional opinions, the Complaints Panel tended to agree that Mr Cheng needed to be admitted to rule out life threatening disease and for close inpatient monitoring",有關保單的條款訂明：「必要的醫療服務」指「治療病痛、不適、疾病或受傷所必須的醫療或保健服務，而有關服務：(i) 須符合病情的診斷及慣常療法；(ii) 須符合良好及謹慎的行醫標準；(iii) 並非為了方便保單持有人、受保人或註冊醫生；及 (iv) 須為承保服務及在正常及慣常費用下進行。」另保單附有「不受保項目」條款，不予承保主要因接受診斷掃描（先進造影除外）、X 光檢查或物理治療的住院，而有關檢查可於門診或日間醫院進行。投訴委員會得悉鄭先生的主診醫生不同意安排於「住院一」進行的檢查是沒有醫療需要及可於門診進行的。鄭先生在入院時出現疑似急性冠狀動脈綜合症，需要在觀察下進行冠狀動脈血管造影檢查，由於他曾患冠狀動脈疾病，這可能誘發致命的心室性心動過速或心室顫動。由於鄭先生於七年前首次被確診患上冠狀動脈疾病，投訴委員會經考慮他的冠狀動脈疾病的病史及主診醫生的專業意見後，傾向同意鄭先生有需要入院，以排除危害生命的疾病及接受密切觀察。,"The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of Mr Cheng and resolved that the insurer should fully settle the hospitalization claim for his first confinement, amounting to around HK$7,300.

Ms Ho then appealed against the decision and submitted a letter from her attending doctor who confirmed that she had acute unstable angina attack with recurrent symptoms of severe chest pain at rest and worsening on exertion.

Besides, he also provided all medical reports relating to his hospitalization for gastritis to the insurer via his servicing agent. The insurer then issued the policy with imposed exclusion of hemorrhoid disease or disorder.Mr Lee suffered from chest pain and palpitation two years after the policy was effected. He was diagnosed with ischemic heart disease and was then admitted to a private hospital for percutaneous coronary intervention. The insurer later discovered that Mr Lee had gallstone, fatty liver, chronic pancreatitis and renal stone as revealed by the abdomen computed tomography (CT) scan performed during his previous hospitalization for gastritis. As such information was not disclosed at the time of policy application, the insurer declined Mr Lee's hospital claim on the grounds of material non-disclosure as the non-disclosed information would have affected its underwriting decision.Mr Lee emphasized that he had already provided all the medical reports relating to his previous hospitalization, including the disputed abdomen CT scan report, to the servicing agent at time of policy application.

However, based on the evidence available, the Complaints Panel tended to believe that the said CT scan report was probably lost at the hands of either the servicing agent or the insurer. Given that Mr Lee had submitted the said CT scan report to the insurer for underwriting via his servicing agent who acts as an agent of the insurer, the Complaints Panel considered that the insurer should be responsible for the internal error in missing the said CT scan report and should treat the case as if it had received the said CT scan report at the time of policy application.",投訴委員會從李先生的保險代理作出的書面聲明得悉，她收到了李先生提交的所有醫療報告（包括有關掃描報告），並將所有申請文件放入保險公司辦事處的指定新保單收集箱內。投訴委員會同意有關掃描報告的異常結果屬重要事實，但是，根據現有的證據，投訴委員會相信有關掃描報告較大可能是於保險代理或保險公司處理保單的過程中丟失。由於李先生是透過他的保險代理（即保險公司委任的代理人）向保險公司遞交有關掃描報告，以作核保之用，投訴委員會因此認為保險公司應為內部錯誤導致有關掃描報告丟失負責，而在處理有關個案時，亦應視作在投保時已收到有關掃描報告。,"The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of Mr Lee. As a major part of the hospitalization expenses incurred had been reimbursed under Mr Lee's group medical benefit, the Complaints Panel resolved that the insurer should settle the remaining hospital expenses of around HK$22,000.

2. a fact within the knowledge of the applicant; and
3. a fact which the applicant could reasonably be expected to disclose.
If there is solid evidence supporting that the insured had disclosed his/her medical history as required in the policy application to the best of his/her knowledge or provided the insurer with the necessary medical documents for its underwriting assessment, the

2) 投保人是否知道有關事實；
3) 預期投保人披露有關事實是否合理。
倘若有實質證據支持受保人於投保時，已根據投保申請書的要求如實披露其已知的病史，或向保險公司提交所需醫療文件作其核保評估，投訴委員會認為保險公司不能僅因行政疏忽或失誤而拒絕承擔賠償責任。"

It thus supported the insurer's decision in declining her claim for right TKA on the grounds of pre-existing condition.On the other hand, since there was no concrete medical evidence proving that Ms Wu had suffered from any left knee problem prior to policy application, the Complaints Panel decided to give the benefit of doubt to Ms Wu and opposed the insurer's decision to reject the aforesaid claim for left TKA for pre-existing condition.",保單的不保事項條款訂明：「若既存症狀在投保書內沒有被全面披露，則保險公司對任何直接或間接因該等既存症狀引致的索賠不予給付任何賠償」；而「既存症狀」是指「1)受保人在保單生效日期……之前已存在的症狀，並已被建議接受或已接受醫學意見、診斷、照顧或治療；或 2) 受保人在保單生效日期……起計之前兩年內已存在的任何病徵或症狀。」從醫學角度來看，骨關節炎是一種退化性疾病，常見症狀為關節疼痛。由於胡女士的右膝疼痛早於 2012 年已出現，約於 2018 年初疼痛加劇，尤其是落樓梯時，投訴委員會因此不相信她的右膝已完全痊癒，遂支持保險公司以她的情況屬「既存症狀」為理由，拒絕有關右膝關節置換術的住院索償。另一方面，由於沒有具體的醫療證據證明胡女士在投保前左膝曾有不適，投訴委員會決定將疑點利益歸予胡女士，反對保險公司以「既存症狀」拒絕賠償左膝關節置換術的住院費用。,"The Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer's decision in rejecting Ms Wu's claim for right TKA, but resolved that the insurer should settle the claim for her left TKA, amounting to around HK$157,000.","投訴委員會同意保險公司拒絕就胡女士的右膝關節置換術作出賠償，惟裁定保險公司需就她接受左膝關節置換術的住院開支作出賠償，涉及金額約 157,000 港元。","""Pre-existing Conditions"" are commonly found in most hospitalization policies to exclude injuries or illnesses which occur, exist or present signs or symptoms before the commencement of the policy coverage.

Two years later, the insured suffered from right scrotal swelling and was diagnosed with right hydrocele. He was then admitted to a private hospital for high ligation of right hydrocele.The insurer declined the hospitalization claim on the grounds that the insured's right hydrocele was a congenital condition which fell within the policy exclusion.According to the insured's attending doctor, the insured complained of right scrotal swelling for two weeks before the first consultation. The underlying cause was idiopathic. There was no documentation of any hydrocele upon reviewing the insured's birth history. He was noted to have swelling by Ms Law at the age of three. Under such background, the attending doctor would not classify the insured's hydrocele under congenital cause.The Insurer noted from the operation record that the operative diagnosis was hydrocele and the procedures were dissection and high ligation of patent processus vaginalis (PPV). As the surgery was obviously a repair of a congenital defect, the insurer maintained its claim decision.",羅女士為 16 個月大的兒子（受保人）投購住院保險，兩年後，受保人出現右側陰囊腫脹，被診斷患上右側鞘膜積液，他其後入住私家醫院接受右側鞘膜積液高位結紮手術。保險公司以受保人的右側鞘膜積液為先天性疾病，屬保單的不保事項為理由，拒絕受理有關住院索償申請。受保人的主診醫生指，受保人於首次求診前右陰囊已腫脹兩星期，原因為突發性；而他的出生紀錄文件並沒有顯示任何鞘膜積液。羅女士於受保人三歲時注意到他右側陰囊腫脹。在這樣的背景下，主診醫生不同意將受保人的鞘膜積液歸納為先天性原因導致。保險公司從手術紀錄得悉，手術的診斷結果為鞘膜積液，手術程序為剖析及高位結紮未關閉的腹膜鞘狀突。由於有關手術明顯是為修復先天性缺陷，保險公司因此維持原來的理賠決定。,"It is stated in the policy exclusions that ""the insurer shall not pay any benefits in relation to or arising from... expenses incurred for medical services provided as a result of congenital conditions which have manifested or been diagnosed before the insured person attained the age of eight years."" And ""congenital condition"" means ""(a) any medical, physical or mental abnormalities existed at the time of or before birth, whether or not being manifested, diagnosed or known at birth; or (b) any neo-natal abnormalities developed within six months of birth"".From the information available, the Complaints Panel noted that there was no evidence showing that the insured's hydrocele was resulted from infection, inflammation, injury within the scrotum or other medical conditions. As hydrocele usually occurs because of non-closure of PPV and the insured underwent the procedure of high ligation of PPV, which is a surgical repair to close the defect at the deep inguinal ring, the Complaints Panel tended to agree that the insured's hydrocele was more likely to be a congenial condition.",保單的不保事項條款訂明：「保險公司不會賠償與下列項目相關或由其引致的費用…… 受保人年屆八歲前發病或確診的先天性疾病所招致的醫療服務費用」；而「先天性疾病」是指「(a) 任何於出生時或之前已存在的醫學、生理或精神上的異常，不論於出生時有關異常是否已出現、被確診或獲知悉；或 (b) 任何出生後六個月內出現的新生嬰兒異常。」根據現有資料，投訴委員會認為沒有證據顯示受保人的鞘膜積液是因感染、炎症或陰囊內受傷或其他醫療狀況導致。由於鞘膜積液一般乃因鞘狀突未完全閉合所致，而受保人接受了鞘狀突高位結紮修復手術以閉合腹股溝環處的缺損，因此，投訴委員會同意受保人所患的鞘膜積液較大可能屬先天性疾病。,"The Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer to decline the hospitalization claim in accordance with the policy exclusion.

Having taken into account the complexity of the surgery and the market median surgeon charge for similar operations, the insurer considered that the surgeon's fee charged was excessive and settled HK$480,000 to Mr Chen, consisting of surgeon's fee HK$100,000 and anesthetist fee HK$35,000 by applying the reasonable and customary (R&C) charges clause in the policy. Mr Chen appealed against the insurer's decision by providing a letter from Dr So, who confirmed that Mr Chen had an enlarging GGO in the superior segment of his right lower lobe that was highly suspicious of an early lung cancer. He underwent uniportal VAT which is the most minimally invasive technique in which only a very small incision was made, and segmentectomy which is a complex way to perform removal of a section of a lobe of the lung.The insurer reassessed the claim with consideration of Dr So's expertise in advanced technique and benchmarked his previous charges for similar surgeries.

Further, the insurer reserves the right to determine whether any particular hospital/medical charge is a R&C charge with reference but not limited to any relevant publication or information made available, such as schedule of fees, by the government, relevant authorities and recognized medical association in the locality. The insurer reserves the right to adjust any and all benefits payable in relation to any hospital/medical charge which in the opinion of the insurer's medical examiner is not a R&C charge.The Complaints Panel noted from the list of private services in Hospital Authority (HA) that ""bronchoscopy"" and ""lobectomy of lung"" were classified as Minor I operation and Ultra-Major I operation respectively and their related fees (including surgeon fee, administration of anesthetics, medicines used in operation and operating theatre expenses) ranged from HK$6,070 to HK$12,750 and from HK$72,050 to HK$88,330. In other words, the insurer's offer was already more than a double of the top end of the range of HA's reference for similar operations.Having further taken into account the complexity of the surgery, expertise and equipment adopted during the surgery and the historical figures of surgeon fee charged by Dr So for alike surgery, the Complaints Panel agreed that the insurer's application of the R&C charges clause in the claims settlement was appropriate.","保單的條款訂明：「合理及慣常收費」是指「……費用或開支不超過在收取費用當地提供類似治療、醫療物品或醫療服務的一般收費標準。未免生疑，對於住院期間提供的治療、醫療物品或醫療服務的收費不得超過適用於標準私家房的收費標準」。此外，保險公司有權根據（但不限於）由當地政府、相關機構及認可之醫療組織提供的有關公布資料如收費表去決定任何該等住院／醫療收費是否合理及慣常收費；若根據保險公司醫務總監的意見，任何住院／醫療收費並非合理及慣常收費，則保險公司有權調整任何或所有就該等收費應支付之利益。投訴委員會從醫院管理局（醫管局）的私家醫療服務項目的收費表中得悉，「支氣管鏡」及「肺葉切除術」分別屬於第一類小型手術及第一類超大型手術，相關費用（包括：外科醫生費、麻醉師費、手術中使用的藥物及手術室費用）介乎 6,070 港元至 12,750 港元及 72,050 港元至 88,330 港元。換言之，保險公司的賠償建議已是醫管局就同類型手術的參考收費範圍上限的兩倍以上。經進一步考慮手術的複雜性、手術過程中採用的專業技術和設備，以及蘇醫生過去就類似手術收取的外科手術費數據後，投訴委員會同意保險公司在理賠中引用「慣常及合理收費」條款的決定恰當。",The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insurer and agreed with its claims offer. ,投訴委員會裁定保險公司向陳先生作出的賠償建議合理。,"R&C charges clause aims to prevent potential abuse of overcharging of medical fees and to control costs for the ultimate benefit of the insuring public.

She was eventually diagnosed as suffering from lung adenocarcinoma with multiple metastases to other organs. She then filed a claim to the Insurer for the cancer benefit.Upon claims investigation, the insurer found that Mrs Lau had suffered from multiple myomas as revealed by the ultrasound reports dated 14 April 2017, 20 May 2017 and 20 October 2018 issued by the hospital. Besides, she also attended the gynecological outpatient department of the hospital on 14 April 2017, 22 May 2017 and 22 October 2018. Given that such information was not disclosed in the policy application and that the non-disclosed information was material which would have affected the insurer's underwriting decision, the insurer declined Mrs Lau's cancer claim on the grounds of material non-disclosure.Mrs Lau disagreed with the insurer's decision and emphasized that her medical check-ups in 2017 and 2018 were routine examinations offered by her employer.

He was only able to speak simple words and was unable to express his needs. He was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from child autism. Mrs Chan then filed a critical illness claim to the insurer for ""severe child disease  autism"".The insurer declined the critical illness claim as there was no report for a clear diagnosis of autism based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). There was also no medical information showing that the insured had severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills or persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contents.",陳太太為兩歲大的兒子（受保人）投購危疾保險。三年後，受保人因與人眼神交流欠佳及語言發育遲緩等症狀前往成都市婦女兒童中心醫院求診，由於他只能說簡單名詞，不能表達自己的需要，故其後被診斷患有兒童自閉症，陳太太遂向保險公司提出「嚴重兒童疾病―自閉症」的危疾索償。保險公司拒絕作出危疾賠償，因為沒有報告明確顯示受保人根據《精神疾病診斷和統計手冊》（DSM-5）診斷患上自閉症，也沒有醫療資料顯示受保人在語言及非語言的社交溝通技巧嚴重不足，或在多種環境下持續缺乏社交溝通及社交互動能力。,"According to the policy provisions, ""autism"" means ""an unequivocal diagnosis by a registered medical practitioner who is a pediatric psychiatrist of a severe form of autism spectrum disorder which must have continued without interruption for a period of at least six months after diagnosis where all of the following conditions are met:

(b) All of the following diagnostic criteria (based on DSM-5) are fulfilled, as certified by the insured's treating pediatric psychiatrist:
(i) Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts, as manifested by:
• severe deficits in verbal and nonverbal social communication skills causing severe impairments in functioning, very limited initiation of social interactions, and minimal response to social overtures from others.
(ii) Restricted, repetitive patterns, of behavior, interests, or activities, as manifested by:
• inflexibility of behavior, extreme difficulty coping with change, or other restricted/repetitive behaviors that markedly interfere with functioning in all spheres.
• great distress/difficultly changing focus or action.
(iii) Symptoms are presenting in early developmental period.
(iv) Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning.""
The Complaints Panel noted from the outpatient record completed by the treating doctor that the insured's clinical descriptions were compatible with severe form of autism. The doctor also confirmed that the insured's diagnosis had fulfilled the policy definition of 
""autism"" and was made based on DSM-5. Other available reports also showed that the insured was assessed to have severe autism  he scored 38 in Childhood Autism Rating Scale (ref: score over 36 for severe autism) and had a score of 12 in the combined social-communication domain in Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (cutoff value for autism: at least 12).Given that CDWCH is one of the insurer's on-list hospitals allowed to provide autism diagnosis in Mainland China and the insured's treating doctor is a qualified doctor to provide child autism assessment, the Complaints Panel tended to accept the professional opinions of the treating doctor and was convinced that the insured's condition fulfilled that policy definition of ""autism""","有關危疾保單的條款訂明：「自閉症」指「經兒童精神專科註冊醫生作出明確診斷，此自閉症系列障礙屬嚴重類型，而有關情況需在診斷後最少持續出現六個月，並必須符合以下所有條件：

(iii) 症狀在早期發展階段出現。
(iv) 症狀對社交、職業或其他重要範圍的現有功能在臨床上造成損害。」
投訴委員會從主診醫生填寫的門診記錄得悉受保人的臨床描述與嚴重自閉症相符，而主診醫生亦確認受保人的診斷結果符合保單內「自閉症」的定義，並根據DSM-5標準診斷。此外，其他報告也顯示受保人被評定患有嚴重自閉症—他在兒童自閉症評定量表的得分為38分（參考值：36分以上為嚴重自閉症），而在自閉症診斷評估的綜合溝通及社會互動領域得分為 12 分（自閉症診斷切點至少為12）。鑑於成都市婦女兒童中心醫院乃屬保險公司獲准在中國內地提供自閉症診斷名單上的醫院之一，而受保人的主診醫生亦是符合資格提供兒童自閉症評估的醫生，故此投訴委員會同意採納主診醫生的專業意見，認為受保人的情況符合保單「自閉症」的定義。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of Mrs Chan and awarded her the critical illness claim of HK$156,000 in respect of the insured's diagnosis of autism.","投訴委員會裁定陳太太得直，保險公司需要就受保人診斷患上自閉症作出 156,000 港元的危疾賠償。","Critical illness contracts cover specific serious illnesses explicitly defined in the policy.

He had an excision surgery and was diagnosed with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). There were uncontrolled growth of malignant cells and clear stromal invasion of malignant cells. He subsequently submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for ""cancer"".The insurer considered DFSP as cancer of connective tissue which can be present everywhere. If it is present at skin, it is a kind of skin cancer. Given that the skin cancer suffered by Mr Tsang was not categorized as malignant melanoma, it was thus excluded from the critical illness benefit for ""cancer"". Instead, the insurer paid the early stage malignancy benefit to Mr Tsang with an amount equivalent to 20% of the sum insured.",曾先生的右肩出現一顆 2.5 厘米 x 2.5 厘米大的腫塊，其後進行切除手術，被診斷患上隆凸性皮膚纖維肉瘤，並出現不受控制的惡性細胞生長及惡性細胞間浸潤的情況。曾先生之後就有關病症向保險公司提出「癌症」的危疾索償申請。保險公司認為隆凸性皮膚纖維肉瘤乃屬結締組織癌，可生長於身體任何部分，若於皮膚上出現，即屬皮膚癌的一種。由於曾先生所患的隆凸性皮膚纖維肉瘤並不屬惡性黑色素瘤的皮膚癌，因此不符合保單內「癌症」定義的要求，保險公司遂不接納曾先生的危疾索償申請，惟向他作出「早期惡性腫瘤」保障的賠償，賠償額為投保金額的 20%。,"It is stipulated in the policy provisions that ""cancer"" means ""a) any malignant tumour positively diagnosed with histological confirmation and characterized by the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells and invasion of tissue; or b) any occurrence of histologically confirmed leukemia, lymphoma or sarcoma... Cancer does not include... any skin cancer, other than malignant melanoma.""The Complaints Panel noted that DFSP is a very rare type of skin cancer that begins in connective tissue cells in the middle layer of skin (dermis). DFSP may at first appear as a bruise or scar. As it grows, lumps of tissue (protuberans) may form near the surface of the skin. Given that DFSP is a skin cancer but does not belong to malignant melanoma, the Complaints Panel agreed that Mr Tsang's condition failed to fulfill the definition of ""cancer"" as stipulated in the policy.",有關保單的條款訂明：「癌症」是指「(a)任何經組織學確診為惡性之腫瘤，並須有惡性細胞已不受控制地生長並侵略其他細胞組織的特徵；或 (b) 任何經組織病理學報告證實為白血病、淋巴瘤或肉瘤……癌症並不包括下列任何一項……任何非黑色素瘤的皮膚癌。」投訴委員會得悉隆凸性皮膚纖維肉瘤屬一種罕見的皮膚癌症，始發於皮膚中層（真皮）的締結組織細胞，初期看起來可能像似瘀傷或傷疤，隨著腫塊生長，皮膚表面可能會形成突起的細胞組織腫塊。由於隆凸性皮膚纖維肉瘤並不屬惡性黑色素瘤的皮膚癌，投訴委員會因此同意曾先生的情況不符合保單內「癌症」的定義。,"The Complaints Panel ruled that the insurer's decision in rejecting the critical illness claim of HK$800,000 but paying the early stage malignancy benefit was fair and appropriate.","投訴委員會裁定保險公司拒絕曾先生提出的800,000 港元的危疾索償申請，但向他賠償「早期惡性腫瘤」保障的決定合理。","Critical illness benefit offers a lump sum to the insured if he/she is diagnosed to have suffered from any of the critical illnesses as stipulated in the policy.

Locally, more than 300mm of rainfall were generally recorded over the territory. According to the weather summary, neither typhon nor strong monsoon signal was issued between 11 and 13 May 2022.Given that only heavy rainfall or rainstorm were recorded during the material time, the Complaints Panel concurred that there was no evidence showing that the incident of water seepage was caused by rain through openings made to the fabric of the buildings by direct force of typhoon or windstorm.",有關保單的「家居財物」不受保事項條款訂明：「本章不會承保下述直接或間接導致的損失或損毀……滲漏造成的損失，但直接因颱風或暴風破壞樓宇結構引致雨水從缺口滲入造成的毀壞除外」。投訴委員會從香港天文台於 2022 年 5 月發出的天氣摘要得悉，一道活躍低壓槽於 5月 11 日至 13 日為珠江口一帶帶來大驟雨及狂風雷暴，本港各區在這三日普遍錄得超過 300 毫米雨量。根據有關紀錄，天文台於2022 年 5 月 11 日至 13 日期間並沒有發出颱風或強烈季候風信號。鑑於事發時本港僅錄得大雨或暴雨，投訴委員會同意沒有證據顯示有關滲水是因颱風或暴風破壞樓宇結構引致雨水從缺口滲入造成。,"The Complaints Panel endorsed the insurer's decision in declining Mr Sin's household claim of nearly HK$41,000 in accordance with the policy exclusion.

He immediately registered with the government online COVID-19 self-declaration system and was issued an isolation order by Centre for Health Protection on the same date. He was required to be isolated at designated premises or isolation venues as ordered by the government for 14 days. Later, Mr Yiu filed a claim to the insurer for daily cash for compulsory quarantine benefit. According to the policy provisions, ""COVID-19"" refers to ""confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by World Health Organization. The diagnosis must always be supported by a relevant test report. Clinical diagnosis alone does not meet this standard.""The insurer declined Mr Yiu's claim on the grounds that RAT was not acceptable as a proof of diagnosis. RAT result failed to fall within the scope of ""relevant test report"" as specified in the policy.As regards Mr Yiu's query that he was unable to go out to conduct a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test during the isolation period, the insurer indicated that the government had arranged PCR test outside the relevant testing centers. Citizens can collect PCR specimen collection pack through various means. The collection and return of the specimen collection pack does not need to be made in person. As such, the insurer believed that it was technically feasible for Mr Yiu who was under the isolation order to conduct a PCR test during the isolation period.",姚先生於 2022 年 3 月自行進行快速抗原測試 (RAT)，結果呈陽性，他隨即在香港特區政府提供的 RAT 陽性結果申報平台登記，並於同日獲衞生防護中心發出隔離令，要求他必須根據政府命令在政府指定處所或指定隔離地點接受隔離 14 天。其後，姚先生向保險公司提出「強制隔離每日現金保障」的索償申請。有關保單的條款訂明：「新型冠狀病毒」是指「世界衛生組織所界定的確診新型冠狀病毒個案。診斷必須獲得相關檢測報告支持。單純的臨床診斷並不符合該標準。」保險公司認為 RAT 結果不符合保單條款訂明的「相關檢測報告」的要求，遂以 RAT 不能作為確診證據為理由，拒絕接納姚先生的索償申請。就姚先生表示未能於隔離令生效期間外出進行逆轉錄聚合酶鏈反應（PCR）測試，保險公司表示除了指定社區檢測中心外，特區政府亦提供其他方式／途徑讓市民進行 PCR 測試，市民可透過各種方式領取深喉唾液測試樣本收集包，而領取收集包及交回樣本均毋須親身處理。據此，保險公司認為姚先生在隔離令生效期間進行PCR 測試於技術上是可行的。,"The Complaints Panel considered that RAT is just a self-test method for COVID-19 and the test result could not verify the identity of the tester by any medical professionals while the isolation order was issued based on a self-declaration with RAT positive. As such, the Complaints Panel viewed that RAT result and the isolation order were not valid proof of diagnosis and did not fall within the scope of ""relevant test report"" as specified in the policy",投訴委員會認為 RAT 僅屬新型冠狀病毒病的一種自我檢測方法，測試結果無法由醫療專業人員驗證測試者的身份；而隔離令則是衞生防護中心按患者自行申報確診新型冠狀病毒病後簽發的命令。因此，投訴委員會同意RAT 結果及隔離令均不是有效及認可的確診證明，不符合有關保障計劃所訂明的「相關檢測報告」的要求。,"The Complaints Panel supported the insurer's decision in declining Mr Yiu's claim for daily cash for compulsory quarantined benefit amounting to HK$7,000.","投訴委員會支持保險公司的決定，不予作出「強制隔離每日現金保障」的賠償，涉及金額 7,000 港元。","To file an insurance claim, an insured has the duty to provide the insurer with all relevant supporting documents for its assessment. For COVID-19 cases, PCR is the gold standard for the diagnosis while RAT plays a role in facilitating access to testing and earlier detection in some people. The Complaints Panel does not view that RAT alone is an acceptable proof of diagnosis of COVID-19 for insurance claims as it is not considered as a test report verified by medical professionals.",在申請保險索償時，受保人有責任向保險公司提供所有與索償相關的資料文件，讓保險公司審核評估。就涉及新型冠狀病毒病相關的個案，PCR 檢測乃診斷測試的黃金標準，而 RAT 則方便部分人進行測試和及早發現感染病毒之用。由於 RAT 結果並沒有經醫療專業人員核實測試報告，投訴委員會因此不認為於保險索賠上單獨一份 RAT 結果可作為診斷新型冠狀病毒病的可接受證明。

經仔細考慮主診醫生提供的進一步資 料後,委員會相信受保人有醫療需要 於住院期間進行冠狀動脈電腦斷層造 影。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insured and resolved that the insurer should pay an extra HK$6,070 to the insured for the expenses relating to the CT coronary angiogram.","投訴委員會裁定受保人得直,保險公司需向他額外發放6,070港元,作為有 關冠狀動脈電腦斷層造影費用的賠 償。","The Complaints Panel often receives cases where insurers declined hospitalization claims on the basis that the investigative tests are not medically necessary to be conducted inpatient since those tests could be safely and effectively performed in an outpatient establishment.

He was admitted to a private hospital for x- ray, laboratory tests and medication treatment. The final diagnosis was mechanical back pain. Since all the tests done could have been effectively and safely performed on an outpatient basis, the insurer considered that the insured's admission to hospital was solely for diagnostic purposes. It therefore declined to settle his hospitalization claim on the grounds that the confinement was not medically necessary.","受保人患有背痛一年,在私家醫院接受X光、化驗及藥物治療,最終被診斷患上機械性背痛。由於他進行的所有測試均可於門診診所有效及安全地進行,保險公司認為受保人的住院純粹為了診斷病 因,故以其住院沒有醫療需要為理由,拒絕他的住院索償申請。","The Complaints Panel learnt from the available information that the insured had consulted another physician for neck and back pain around two weeks before his admission. He indicated his anxiety about weight gain with related health concerns and opted for admission for workup.
The insured received a series of investigative tests during the confinement. However, apart from oral medication, there was no essential treatment given to him. Some of the tests such as prostate-specific antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen and electrocardiogram were done for the sake of cancer marker and medical baseline checking which were not related to the insured's diagnosis. Furthermore, the confinement was marked ""elective"" in nature instead of ""emergency"" in the nursing assessment.
Given that the investigative tests could have been done on an outpatient basis and that the purpose of the admission was solely to find out the cause of the insured's pain condition, the Complaints Panel agreed that the insured's confinement was not medically necessary.","投訴委員會從現有資料中得悉受保人 於入院前兩星期,曾因頸背痛向另一 位醫生求診,並表示擔憂體重上升及 相關健康問題而選擇住院跟進。
受保人於住院時曾接受一系列的檢 查,惟除了口服藥物外,他並沒有接 受任何必要的治療,而部分測試根本 與受保人的診斷無關,例如:前列腺 癌抗原檢查、癌胚抗原檢查及心電 圖,乃屬癌症風險評估及醫療基線檢 查。此外,於護士評估報告內,受保 人的住院安排被標示為「選擇性」, 而非「緊急性」。
鑑於有關測試檢查大可於門診診所進 行,而住院的目的只為診斷受保人的 痛症原因,委員會因此同意受保人的 住院沒有醫療需要。","The Complaints Panel supported the insurer's decision to decline the hospitalization claim for about HK$8,000.","投訴委員會支持保險公司拒絕住院醫 療賠償的決定,涉及金額約8,000港元。","If there is concrete evidence to show that the hospital confinement is arranged solely for conducting diagnostic or laboratory tests with no element of medical emergency, the Complaints Panel will generally agree that such confinement is not medically necessary.","倘若有充分證據證明住院純粹是為了 接受診斷或測試,而當中並不涉及醫 療緊急的情況,投訴委員會一般會同 意這類住院沒有醫療需要。"

No external signs of injury were noted. He was referred to have magnetic resonance imaging on the same day. The final diagnosis was spondylolisthesis C5 and S1. Most of the medical expenses were settled by the insured's hospitalization policy with another insurer. The complainant (mother of the insured) submitted an accident claim to the insurer for the remaining medical expenses incurred. However, due to lack of evidence proving that the claimed loss was caused by accidental bodily injury, the insurer rejected the claim.","受保人因下背痛向私家醫院門診部求診,原因是16天前在學校上體育課時做提腿動作所導致,應診時受保人的身體表面並沒有損傷,受保人同日被轉介接受磁力共振,最終被確診患上頸椎第五節及骶椎第一節前移。
受保人的大部分醫療費用已從另一家保險公司承保的醫療住院計劃獲得賠償,投訴人(受保人的母親)只就餘下的醫療費用向保險公司提出意外索償申請。然而, 由於沒有證據確實有關索償乃由意外受傷所導致,保險公司因此拒絕賠償。","According to the policy provisions of the personal accident insurance, ""accidental bodily injury"" means ""an injury effected directly and independently of all other causes by accident as evidenced by a visible bruise or wound on the body"".
It is also stated in the policy that "" .. .. written proof of loss, such as the necessary information, documents, medical evidence and reports signed by a doctor, which the insurer requires the insured to provide at his/her expense must be received by the insurer within 90 days after it receives written notice of the claim"".
The Complaints Panel noted that the insured sought medical consultation for back pain only 16 days after the alleged accident. The attending physician stated in the claim form that the insured sustained sudden lower back pain while lifting his leg during the PE lesson and opined that his injury might be related to congenital anomalies. The insurer had advised the complainant to provide all investigation reports for its review. However, she refused to provide such reports but requested the insurer to contact the hospital directly for further clarification.
Having duly considered all the relevant facts, the Complaints Panel did not think that ""sudden onset of pain while lifting leg"" and ""spondylolisthesis C5 and S1"" would be regarded as an accident. Furthermore, there was a lack of objective evidence to prove beyond doubt that the insured's condition was caused solely and directly by an accident independent of all other causes.","有關個人意外保單的條款訂明:「意 外受傷」是指「直接及純粹因意外而 非其他原因,導致身體受傷,並有明 顯的瘀傷或傷口」。

投訴委員會得悉,受保人於聲稱的意 外發生後16天才就背痛求診,而主診 醫生於索償表格中指出,受保人於上 體育課做提腿動作時突然感到下背 痛,認為有關受傷或與先天性異常有 關。保險公司曾建議投訴人提供所有 檢查報告以作查核,惟她拒絕,並要 求保險公司直接聯絡醫院查問。
委員會仔細考慮所有相關事實後,並 不認為「提腿時突然感到痛楚」及 「頸椎第五節及骶椎第一節前移」屬 意外事故。此外,現時亦沒有客觀證 據可毫無疑點地證明受保人的情況是 純粹及直接因意外事故造成,並不涉 及其他因素。","Since the burden of proof was on the complainant to provide the insurer with the necessary information to prove the case, in the absence of such information, the Complaints Panel supported the insurer's decision in rejecting the accident claim for around HK$2,000.","基於投訴人有責任向保險公司提交所 需資料,以證明受保人的情況符合保 單的要求,在欠缺相關資料的情況 下,投訴委員會支持保險公司拒絕賠 償意外醫療費用的決定,涉及金額約 2,000港元。","In order to ascertain whether or not an injury was caused directly and independently by an accident, the Complaints Panel will consider the nature of the injury and the diagnoses made by the attending doctor.

He slipped and rolled down from a slope and resulted in severe back/neck pain and left leg swelling. He was granted sick leaves for more than two years. The insurer granted permanent total disability (PTD) benefit to him one year after the accident for 60 consecutive months.
When the complainant submitted further claim for his continued disability, the insurer noted that he suffered Parkinson's disease two years after the accident with impairment in activities of daily living. Since the complainant's disability was due to Parkinson's disease and there was no supportive evidence to prove that his continued disability was caused directly and independently by an accident, the insurer declined his further claim for PTD benefit.","投訴人是一名園丁,10年前工作時從山坡失足滾下受傷,導致背/頸部嚴重痛楚及左腳腫脹,他因而獲發病假愈兩年,保險公司於意外發生一年後向他發放連續60個月的「永久完全傷殘保障」賠僧。當投訴人就其持續傷殘再度提出索償時,保險公司發現投訴人在意外發生後兩年患上柏金遜症, 日常活動能力受損。由於投訴人的傷殘乃因柏金遜症導致,加上現時沒有具體證據證明他的持續傷殘是純粹及直接因意外事故導致, 保險公司因此拒絕他再度就「永久完全傷殘保障」提出的索償申請。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions of the personal accident contract that ""When as a result of injury and commencing within 180 days from the date of an accident, the insured is totally and permanently disabled and prevented from engaging in any gainful work, occupation or business for which he/she is reasonably qualified or fitted by knowledge, training or experience, the insurer shall pay, provided such disability has continued for a period of 12 consecutive months, the principal sum in monthly installments payable at the end of each month during such total, continuous and permanent disability, at the rate of 1% per month for not more than 100 months. If during the 100 month period the disability ceases or the insured becomes able to return to work, the payments under this benefit shall immediately cease"".
From the various medical reports, the Complaints Panel noted that the complainant suffered Parkinson's disease two years after the accident and received medical treatment since then. The doctors opined that his Parkinsonism was unrelated to the injury 10 years ago but his medical condition was complicated by depression and Parkinsonism. He was not expected to have a fundamental or marked change of his present condition in future as Parkinson's disease was a progressive neuro-degenerative disorder.
The Complaints Panel was inclined to believe that the complainant's current disability was more likely contributed by his Parkinsonism rather than the residual injury of the accident occurred 10 years ago.","有關個人意外保單的條款訂明:「倘 在意外發生後180日內,受保人因意 外受傷而引致永久完全傷殘,並無法 從事符合其知識、訓練或經驗,並可

投訴委員會從多份醫療報告得悉,投 訴人於意外發生後兩年患上柏金遜 症,並自此接受相關治療,醫生認為 他的柏金遜症與10年前的受傷無關, 而他的病況亦因抑鬱症及柏金遜症而 變得複雜。由於柏金遜症是一種越趨 嚴重的腦部神經退化疾病,醫生預計 投訴人現時的狀況在將來不會有基本 或明顯的改善。
投訴委員會傾向相信投訴人現時的傷 殘較大可能是因他的柏金遜症導致, 而非10年前的意外事故殘留的損傷。","As there was no substantial evidence to prove that the complainant's current disability was caused solely and directly by an accidental injury independent of all other causes, the Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer's decision in declining the complainant's claim for further PTD benefit amounting to approximately HK$128,700.","由於沒有充分證據證明投訴人現時的 傷殘是純粹及直接因意外事故導致, 而不涉及其他因素,投訴委員會贊同 保險公司拒絕投訴人再度申索「永久 完全傷殘保障」的決定合理,涉及金 額大約128,700港元。","In determining whether or not an insured is entitled to further accident claim in case of a continued disability, the Complaints Panel pays particular attention to whether the further claim is in any way related to the previous injury.

He was admitted to a private hospital twice for left and right total knee replacement respectively, of which the two confinements were separated by a period of seven months. The diagnosis of the two confinements was bilateral osteoarthritis (OA) knees.
The insurer settled most of the medical expenses incurred in the complainant's first confinement, but considered that his second confinement was for the subsequent follow up treatment of his bilateral OA knees during the first hospitalization. The insurer then treated the two hospitalizations as arisen from the same disability. Since the amount settled under the miscellaneous (misc.) expenses benefit for the complainant's first hospitalization was very close to the maximum limit payable for such benefit, the insurer only paid the residual amount under the misc. expenses benefit for his second hospitalization.

The Complaints Panel noted that the complainant had already suffered from bilateral knee pain for 10 years when he first sought consultation. Given that the diagnosis for his two confinements was bilateral OA knees and that his right knee had not recovered until he underwent the right knee operation during the second confinement, the Complaints Panel accepted the insurer's view that the two confinements should be considered as arisen from the same disability.","有關住院保單的條款訂明:「傷病」 是指「受傷、不適、疾病或病痛,並 包括由同一原因造成的所有傷病及其 一切併發症。不過,若受保人完全康 復持續90天(由最後經註冊醫生治療 或出院日起計算,以較後者為準), 任何繼發的治療皆作新的傷病計 算」。投訴委員會得悉,投訴人首次求診時 已患有雙膝疼痛十年,鑑於他兩次住 院的診斷結果均為雙膝骨關節炎,而 他右膝的病況一直持續至第二次入院 接受右膝關節置換術,從未康復,委 員會因此接納保險公司的看法,把投 訴人的兩次住院視作因同一傷病導 致。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insurer and supported its decision in declining the remaining misc. expenses incurred during the complainant's second confinement, amounting to approximately HK$46,000.","投訴委員會裁定保險公司得直,支持 拒絕就投訴人第二次住院餘下約 46,000港元的雜費作出賠償。","Nearly all medical insurance policies have ""same disability"" provision to limit its coverage to recurrent confinements due to disabilities arising from the same cause.

As terrorism is one of the insured perils as stated under the ""cancellation of trip"" benefit of the travel policy, the complainant filed a claim to the insurer for the irrecoverable air tickets fares and the hotel cancellation fee.

The Complaints Panel noted that the government of Thailand did not announce the bomb attack incident as a ""terrorist attack"" and there was no individual or group claiming responsibility for this particular incident.

As the policy does not cover congenital condition, the insurer declined the hospitalization claim.","一名19歲青年因強直陣攣發作持續數分鐘,接受腦部磁力共振掃描,被確診患上海綿狀血管瘤,他 其後在私家醫院接受開腦切除腦腫瘤手術。由於大部分醫療文獻普遍支持海綿狀血管瘤屬先天性情 況,保險公司因此認為受保人的診斷屬先天性;鑑於保單並不承保先天性疾病,保險公司遂拒絕有 關住院索償申請。","It is stipulated in the policy provisions of the hospitalization policy that ""congenital conditions"" shall mean ""any medical, physical or mental abnormalities existed at the time of birth, whether or not being manifested, diagnosed or known about at birth or any neo-natal abnormalities developed within six months of birth"".
The Complaints Panel noted that the attending physician confirmed that the insured's condition was not due to or associated with congenital condition since most cavernous haemangioma are not found at birth and the lesions are usually developed in the first few years after birth.
On the other hand, the Complaints Panel also learnt from some available medical literatures that ""most cases of cavernous are congenital, however, they can develop over the course of a lifetime. ..... "" and ""not all cavernomas are present at birth and in some cases they develop where the pressure where the brain has been subjected to high pressure within the veins over prolonged periods of time"".
Based on the above, the Complaints Panel was not convinced that there was concrete and sufficient medical evidence to prove that the insured's cavernous haemangioma or its symptoms had existed at birth or developed within six months after birth.

受保人的主診醫生最後收取了180,000港元的手術費,保險公司遂按照付款保證信訂明的條款支付手 術費,並要求受保人繳付54,875港元的手術費差額。","According to the policy provisions of the medical policy, ""the insurer will pay the insurance benefits ...... as follows: all costs incurred must be medically necessary and subject to reasonable and customary charges .... "" while ""reasonable and customary charges"" shall mean ""the average amount charged in respect of valid services or treatment costs, as determined by the insurer's experience in any particular country, area or region and substantiated by an independent third party, being a practicing surgeon/ physician/specialist or government health department"".
The Complaints Panel noted that the insurer's estimation on the R&C charges was based on its own internal claims experience and references from other private hospitals, including the one the insured stayed for her surgery, for similar surgeries. Since the insurer's R&C range for the surgery of ""thyroidectomy, total or subtotal for malignancy with limited neck dissection"" was HK$100, 100, its approved surgeon fee of HK$125,125 had already included a 25% buffer.
Based on the above, the Complaints Panel was convinced that the insurer's final offer was reasonable and in full accordance with the terms in the GOP. Furthermore, the insurer had already informed the insured before the surgery of the fact that the surgeon fee charged by her doctor was higher than its R&C range and had provided her with the approved amount of surgeon fee.","有關醫療保單的條款訂明:「保險公 司將會支付以下的保障項目 ……: 所 有具醫療需要並符合合理及慣常收費 的費用 …… 」而「合理及慣常收費」 乃指「關於合資格服務或治療費用的 平均合理收費,乃根據保險公司於某 國家、地區或區域的經驗而釐定,以 及由獨立的第三方包括外科醫生/醫 生/專科醫生或政府醫療部門證 實」。
投訴委員會得悉,保險公司對合理及 慣常收費的評估乃根據其內部索償的 經驗及參考其他私家醫院(包括受保 人入院接受手術的那所醫院)對同類 型手術的收費。保險公司對「甲狀腺 切除術,全部或部分針對惡性腫瘤的 局部頸淋巴結根除」的合理及慣常收 費為100,100港元,故獲批准的 125,125港元手術費,已預留了25% 的緩衝額。
基於上述理由,投訴委員會認為保險 公司的最終賠償方案合理,並完全符 合付款保證信內的條款。此外,保險 公司於手術前已通知受保人,其主診 醫生收取的手術費高於保險公司的合 理及慣常收費,並知會了她獲批准的 手術費金額。",The Complaints Panel supported the insurer's decision to settle the hospital bill according to the terms as stated in the GOP.,投訴委員會贊同保險公司根據付款保 證信所顯示的條款支付有關醫院賬單。,"It is common to have ""reasonable and customary charges"" clause in hospitalization insurance contracts.

The Complaints Panel noted that there was no open wound, but only swelling at right ankle and the lumbar region when the complainant was first admitted to the private hospital after the fall injury at home. Magnetic resonance imaging of right ankle revealed ankle joint effusion with bony erosion and suspected right ankle infection while right ankle aspiration confirmed pus cells with gram negative Bacilli.
Besides, the medical report from the public hospital revealed that the complainant had a history of right ankle post-traumatic arthritis. He had right foot first web plantar wound after impingement by callosity around two weeks before the alleged accident.
The Complaints Panel considered that the fall and slip injury was minor as there was no bone fracture or open wound. It was not convinced that the alleged injury would result in severe ankle septic arthritis, pus collection over right foot region and the subsequent right below knee amputation. As the complainant had open wound in his right foot plantar after impingement by callosity prior to the alleged injury, the Complaints Panel was more inclined to believe that the severe infection with sepsis in his ankle joint was triggered by multiple factors rather than the sole and independent result of the alleged injury.","個人意外保單條款訂明:「若受保人

The Complaints Panel noted from the cardiac CT scanning that the complainant sustained from subtotal occlusion in LAD, 60% stenosis in LM and 70% stenosis in posterior left ventricular (PLV). The attending doctor indicated that the complainant's LCX is non-dominant and small in size. Hence, his RCA is the very dominant artery and his PLV is as large as the LCX. However, as PLV is only a branch of RCA and is not equivalent to RCA, even though 70% stenosis in PLV was found, the Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer that the complainant's condition did not meet the criteria for claiming ""Other Serious Coronary Artery Disease"" under the critical illness policy.","有關危疾保單條款訂明:「其他嚴重 冠狀動脈疾病」是指「不論受保人曾 否接受任何冠狀動脈外科手術,經冠 狀動脈造影檢查證實最少一條冠狀動 脈管腔縮窄達75%,以及另外兩條管 腔縮窄達60%。此段冠狀動脈是指左 主幹、左前降支、回旋支及右冠狀動 脈」。

2015-2016,Critical Illness,Application of Policy Terms,保單條款的詮釋,4,"Definition of ""Benign Brain Tumour""",「良性腦腫瘤」的定義,,,"The complainant consulted her private doctor for menstrual irregularity for about one year. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed parasellar tumour whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested differential diagnosis including meningioma, left trigeminal schwannoma or pituitary adenoma. The tumour was then treated by cyberknife radiosurgery. She later submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for ""Benign Brain Tumour"".
The insurer declined the claim as the clinical features suggested that the diagnosis was pituitary adenoma, which was excluded from the definition of ""Benign Brain Tumour"" under the policy.","投訴人因月經失調大約一年向私家醫生求診,電腦斷層掃描結果顯示鞍旁腫瘤,而磁力共振 結果提供的鑑別診斷則包括腦膜瘤、左三叉神經病變或腦垂體腺瘤。投訴人接受了電腦刀放 射手術切除腫瘤,其後,就「良性腦腫瘤」向保險公司提出危疾保險索償申請。由於根據臨床徵狀,受保人獲診斷為腦垂體腺瘤,因此,保險公司拒絕賠償,原因是「良性 腦腫瘤」的定義並不包括腦垂體腺瘤。","According to the provisions of the critical illness policy, ""Benign Brain Tumour"" means ""a non-cancerous tumour in the brain which must be confirmed by imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI. Cysts, granulomas, malformations in, or of, the arteries or veins of the brain, haematomas and tumours in the pituitary gland or spine are excluded"".
The Complaints Panel noted from the clinical laboratory report that the complainant had a high level of prolactin in blood. Prolactin is secreted by the pituitary gland and one of the common causes of high prolactin may be adenoma at the pituitary gland. Furthermore, MRI revealed an irregular solid tumour over the left parasellar region that was inseparable with the left side of the pituitary gland and invaded into the left cavernous sinus.
Since MRI confirmed that the tumour was situated in the pituitary gland and the complainant had presented with features such as high prolactin level which strongly suggested that the diagnosis was pituitary adenoma, the Complaints Panel agreed that the complainant's medical condition should be excluded from the definition of ""Benign Brain Tumour"".","有關危疾保單條款訂明:「良性腦腫 瘤」指「非惡性腦腫瘤,診斷必須以 影像檢查確定,例如:電腦掃描或磁 力共振造影,惟囊腫、肉芽腫、腦動 脈或靜脈畸形、血腫、腦垂體或脊骨 腫瘤均不包括在良性腦腫瘤的定義 內」。
投訴委員會從化驗報告中得悉,投訴 人的催乳素偏高,而催乳素主要是由 腦垂體分泌,導致催乳素偏高的其中 一個原因是腦垂體腺瘤。此外,磁力 共振結果亦顯示一個不規則狀的腫瘤 位於左鞍旁區,與腦垂體左方不能分 開,並入侵左邊海綿寶。
由於磁力共振檢查結果確定該腫瘤位 於腦垂體,而投訴人的催乳素偏高亦 明確顯示該腫瘤屬腦垂體腺瘤,投訴 委員會因此同意投訴人的病況不應包 括在「良性腦腫瘤」的定義內。","The Complaints Panel supported the insurer's decision in rejecting the critical illness claim for ""Benign Brain Tumour"" amounting to HK$234,000.","投訴委員會支持保險公司拒絕就「良 性腦腫瘤」作出危疾賠償的決定,涉 及金額234,000港元。","It is common for insurers to impose exclusions in the definitions of critical illnesses to exclude certain illnesses which insurers do not intend to provide coverage.

He received laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal tumour two months later. subsequently submitted a critical illness claim to the insurer for ""Cancer"". He

由於沒有證據顯示惡性細胞擴散並入侵正常組織,故保險公司認為受保人的病況不符合保單 內「癌症」的定義,拒絕作出危疾賠償。","It is stipulated in the provisions of the critical illness policy that ""Cancer"" means ""a disease manifested by the presence of malignant tumours characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of malignant cells, and invasion of normal tissue ...... All skin cancers ...... are excluded as well as premalignant tumours or polyps and carcinoma in situ"".
The Complaints Panel noted that the first histopathology report after polypectomy had confirmed rectal polyp of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising from tubular adenoma, but there was no lymphovascular permeation by tumour. Whereas the second histopathology report after laparoscopic low anterior resection confirmed rectal tumour with scanty residual moderately differentiated intramucosal adenocarcinoma and its stage was pTisNO (""Tis"" means ""cancer in its earliest stage (in-situ)"" and ""NO"" represents ""no cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes"").
Having duly reviewed the histological reports, the Complaint Panels considered that there was no evidence of spread of malignant cells and invasion of normal tissue in the insured's case. As the insured's cancer cells were confined inside the polyp and did not invade into the submucosa of colon, his condition was at the stage of carcinoma-in-situ which was excluded under the ""Cancer"" definition of the critical illness policy.","有關危疾保單訂明:「癌症」是指「惡 性腫瘤,其特徵為惡性細胞不受控制 地生長、擴散及侵襲正常組織 …… 不 包括所有皮膚癌 …… 以及任何癌前病 變、非侵潤性原位癌」。

The symptoms aggravated three days before her admission. The insured had undergone a series of investigations and was given mainly acupuncture and oral medication during her confinement.
Given that the investigations and treatments received by the insured during the hospitalization could have been done on an outpatient basis and that there was no evidence to show that her admission was of urgent or emergency nature, the Complaints Panel was of the opinion that her confinement was prolonged and it was not medically necessary for her to be admitted for 16 days.","根據住院入息保障條款訂明:「倘若受 保人於保單有效期內因受傷或疾病而 需要入住醫院,保險公司將按受保人 的留院日數 …… 賠償受保人每日住院 現金保障 ..... o J

基於受保人是次入院進行的診斷性檢 查及治療均可於日間門診進行,而現 有資料亦未能顯示是次住院屬緊急性 質或有迫切性,因此,投訴委員會認 為受保人的住院日數過長,且並非醫 療需要而住院16天。","The Complaints Panel supported the insurer's decision to offer five days hospital income benefit of HK$4,000 to the insured.","投訴委員會支持保險公司向受保人賠 償五天住院入息保障的決定,金額合 共4,000港元。","Medical claims disputes arise as many insureds tend to believe that 'having been admitted to hospital' will naturally qualify them to receive ""daily hospital income benefit"".

She was admitted to a private hospital for computed tomography positron emission tomography (CT PET) scan. Since no recurrence of tumour was found, she was discharged the next day. Although the CT PET scan was a necessary investigation for the insured's condition of carcinoma of bladder, the insurer was of the view that the CT PET scan could be effectively performed on an outpatient basis and the insured's hospital confinement mainly for monitoring and surveillance for residual or recurrent tumour should not be considered as medically necessary.

Since the circumstances may differ greatly from case to case, when reviewing this type of dispute, the Complaints Panel pays particular attention to the following:
1. whether the attending physician had declared and provided valid reason(s) that it was, in his/her opinion, necessary to admit the patient;
2. whether any treatment was given during the hospitalization, other than diagnostic tests done; and
3. whether the diagnostic tests formed part of the treatment which had to be done in a hospital setting.
If it can be shown that the hospital confinement is arranged purely for conducting diagnostic or laboratory tests with no element of medical emergency, the Complaints Panel will usually rule in favour of the insurer.","投訴委員會曾處理多宗有關保險公司 以受保人沒有住院需要而拒絕住院賠 償的投訴個案,保險公司的理據主要 是受保人在住院期間沒有接受治療, 或所接受的診斷性檢查可於日間門診 進行。由於每宗個案的情況或會有很大的差 異,故此,投訴委員會在審理此類糾 紛時,會留意下列各項:
1. 主診醫生有沒有明確指出及提供合 理的理由,認為病者必須入院;
2. 受保人在住院期間除了進行診斷性 檢查外,有否接受任何治療;
3. 診斷性檢查是否屬治療的其中一部 分,並且必須在醫院內進行。

He could not exclude the chance that the insured's VUR was congenital in nature. However, the doctor responsible for the insured's second and third confinements confirmed that the insured's recurrent febrile of UTI associated with gross VUR and renal scarring presented only after one year of age and was thus not a congenital condition.

Although there was room for the insurer to improve its processing time for risk re-assessment and the communication process with the insured, the Complaints Panel agreed that the insured's hypertension history was material and would have prejudiced the insurer from making a fair and accurate underwriting assessment at the time of policy application.","投訴委員會從保險公司的核保手冊中 得悉,受保人重新申報的高血壓病歷 的確會影響保險公司核保其住院及手 術保障的決定。
儘管保險公司在重新評核風險的處理 時間及與受保人溝通的過程上,仍有 改善的空間,惟投訴委員會同意受保 人的高血壓病歷屬重要事實,並會影 響保險公司在保單申請時作出公平和 準確的承保決定。","The Complaints Panel concurred with the insurer's decision in rejecting the hospitalization claim of around HK$138,000 for material non-disclosure.","投訴委員會贊同保險公司以受保人沒 有披露重要事實為理由,拒絕其住院 賠償,涉及金額約138,000港元。","Insurance contracts are based on trust. The insurer trusts the policyholder to give precise and true details of the subject matter to be insured. This is called ""the principle of Utmost Good Faith"". The nature of the subject matter of insurance and the circumstances pertaining to it are facts within the knowledge of the insured. Insurers, on the other hand, are not aware of these facts unless the insured tells them. The insured, therefore, is always obliged to tell the whole truth.
If the information provided in the application form is inaccurate, the insurer will have the right to decline claim payment even if the non-disclosed information is not related to the current illness. This is because the non-disclosure has prejudiced the insurer from making a fair and accurate underwriting assessment.
The decision as to whether a piece of information is important in underwriting lies with the insurer, not the applicant. Applicants for insurance should always bear in mind that non-disclosure can result in policy repudiation and claim rejection. In order to avoid unnecessary claims disputes, one should disclose all information fully and accurately when filling in the application form. If in doubt as to whether a fact is material, it is better to disclose it.","保單合約建基於信任,保險公司信任 保單持有人會對投保事項提供準確和 真實的資料,此之謂「最高誠信原 則」。投保事項的性質、與之相關的 各種狀況,均是受保人認知範圍內的 事實,除非受保人主動相告,否則, 保險公司不會知道,因此,投保人有 義務交代所有事實。

2015-2016,Hospitalization,Amount of Indemnity,賠償金額,13,Public Acute Ward Maintenance Fee,公眾急症病房費用,,,"The insured was a resident in the Mainland. During her stay in Hong Kong, she consulted a government outpatient clinic for fever, headache and rash and was advised to have hospital confinement. She was subsequently admitted to a public hospital for blood test and medication. She was discharged the next day and was charged for public acute ward maintenance fee of HK$4,680.
As the insured was not a Hong Kong resident, the Hospital Authority charged her HK$4,680 for one-day confinement. The insurer then paid her one-day room and board fee of HK$800.","受保人是一名內地居民,她在香港逗留期間因發燒、頭痛及出疹到政府門診求診,並獲建議 到醫院接受治療,她隨後入住公立醫院,並接受血液檢查及藥物治療,她於翌日出院,並支 付了4,680港元的公眾急症病房費用。
由於受保人並非香港居民,醫管局向她收取4,680港元作為一天的住院費用,而保險公司則 向她發放一天的住房及膳食費用,合共800港元。","The Complaints Panel noted from the insured's allegation that she had received blood test, injection and medication during her confinement in the public hospital. She had tried to ask the hospital for an itemized bill showing the breakdown of the charges incurred. However, the hospital replied that it could only provide a standard receipt with no itemized breakdown.
Given that there was no breakdown of the charges incurred, the Complaints Panel accepted the basis of argument of the insurer for reimbursing the insured only one-day room & board fee of HK$800.
However, as the charge of HK$4,680 should have included fees for other medical services rendered during the confinement in addition to room and board, the Complaints Panel believed that there were extenuating circumstances that would merit the insurer to consider granting of an ex- gratia payment.","投訴委員會得悉受保人聲稱她於公立 醫院住院期間曾接受血液檢查、注射 和藥物治療,她亦嘗試向醫院索取收 據細明單,以顯示分項收費;然而, 醫院回覆只能提供沒有逐項細明分類 的標準收據。
基於沒有收費細明分類,投訴委員會 接納保險公司只向受保人賠償一天的 住院及膳食費用,合共800港元。
然而,公立醫院收取的4,680港元,除 了住房及膳食費用外,還應包括住院 期間提供的其他醫療服務,投訴委員 會認為此個案案情特殊,保險公司值 得考慮作出通融賠償。","The Complaints Panel recommended the insurer to consider increasing the claim payment on an ex-gratia basis. The insurer concurred and paid the insured the remaining balance of the hospital claim of HK$3,880.","投訴委員會建議保險公司考慮酌情增 加賠償金額,保險公司同意,並發放 住院索償餘額3,880港元。","The Complaints Panel understands that most of the hospital plans in the market are designed based on the way of billings presented by private hospitals in Hong Kong. Hospital claims are usually paid by categorizing the different items in the hospital bills into various benefits under the policy. The common types of benefits include room and board fees, doctor's visit fees, surgical fees, anaethetist's fees, operating theatre fees and miscellaneous hospital expenses.
In cases where the hospital bill does not have a breakdown for the detailed medical services rendered to the insured during his/her confinement, the insurer may not be able to make a precise adjustment in the claim.","投訴委員會明白市場上大部分的住院 計劃乃根據香港私家醫院的收費模式 設計,並會按醫院收據上的不同收費 項目,歸納為保單內不同的保障項目 而作出賠償。常見的保障項目包括: 住院及膳食費用、醫生巡房費、手術 費、麻醉師費、手術室費及住院雜 費。
如果醫院收據沒有詳列受保人在住院 期間接受的各項醫療服務收費,保險 公司在理賠時便未必能夠作出準確的 調整。"

She subsequently submitted a claim to the insurer under her hospital policy in which the policy schedule stated that hospital services and oncology treatment were ""fully covered up to the annual policy limit of US$100,000"".
The insurer fully paid the expenses incurred for the insured's first confinement. As regards the second and third confinements, the insurer applied the reasonable and customary (R&C) clause to exclude those costs which were above the common standard of charges.","一位女士因患上右乳癌三度入住私家醫院,分別接受立體定位穿刺活檢、保留乳頭乳暈的全 乳切除術和前哨淋巴結活檢及全乳房切除手術。她隨後向保險公司提交住院索償申請,而根 據其住院保單的保障承保表,住院服務及癌症治療均可獲「全數賠償至保單年度上限 100,000美金」。
保險公司全數支付受保人第一次的住院費用。至於第二及第三次住院,保險公司則引用合理 及慣常收費條款,豁免該些超出普遍收費標準的費用。","From the information available, the Complaints Panel took note of the following:
1. The insurer received the provisional quotations from the insured prior to her second and third confinements. The insurer had expressed its observation of the higher than usual surgery and anesthetics charges. It had advised the insured and her broker that it would apply the R&C clause to exclude costs which were above standard. On the other hand, the insurer agreed to approve certain amounts as the surgeon fees for her second and third confinements, as well as the respective anesthetic fees at 30% of those of the surgeon fees.
2. When making estimation on the R&C charges, the insurer had made reference to its claims experience, the industry's claims statistics and the common fee schedule for mastectomy done in a private room of a private hospital. It considered that the usual and customary total hospitalization cost for mastectomy in a private room is around HK$100,000 to HK$120,000.
3. The insurer had adopted the higher R&C charges for the more complex procedure of mastectomy when assessing the insured's hospital claim. Its final reimbursement amount of HK$180,000 each for the second and third hospital confinements was already 50% above the usual and customary total hospitalization cost for mastectomy.
Based on the above, the Complaints Panel noted that the insured was fully advised of the fact that R&C clause would be applied to her latter two surgical procedures, as well as the respective pre-approved limits for surgeon's and anesthetist's fees prior to her operations. Given that the insurer's calculation and explanation on its final claims adjustment was not unreasonable, the Complaints Panel agreed with the insurer to apply the R&C clause in its final settlement of the insured's hospital expenses.","根據現有資料,投訴委員會得悉下列 各項:
1. 在受保人第二及第三次住院前,保 險公司已收到她的臨時報價單,並 表示留意到手術費及麻醉師費高於 慣常收費,故通知受保人及其保險 經紀將會引用合理及慣常收費條 款,豁免超出普遍收費標準的費 用。另一方面,保險公司批核某限 額作為受保人第二及第三次住院的 手術費,以及有關麻醉師費,金額
為手術費的30%。
2. 當評估合理及慣常收費時,保險公 司已參考其索償經驗、業界的索償 數據及某間私家醫院就私家病房進 行全乳房切除手術的常用收費表。 保險公司認為在私家病房進行全乳 房切除手術的合理及慣常總住院費 大約是100,000至120,000港元。
3. 保險公司在審核受保人的住院索償 時已根據較複雜的全乳房切除術進 行評估,並採用較高的合理及慣常 收費,而受保人的第二及第三次住 院的最終賠償各為180,000港元, 已較一般及慣常涉及全乳房切除術 的總住院費用多出50%。
基於上述,投訴委員會明白受保人在 進行第二及第三次手術之前,已獲保 險公司告知會應用合理及慣常收費條 款,以及預先審批的手術費及麻醉師 費的限額。鑑於保險公司調整其最終 賠償的計算方法及相關解釋並非不合 理,投訴委員會因此同意保險公司於 最終賠償時,引用合理及慣常收費條 款。","The Complaints Panel ruled in favour of the insurer and resolved that the insurer was not liable to pay those expenses of HK$223,400, which was in excess of the R&C charges.","投訴委員會贊同保險公司毋須支付該 筆超出合理及慣常收費的住院費用, 涉及金額223,400港元。","In recent years, more and more people opt for premium hospital plans which provide comprehensive ""full cover"" benefit to most types of medical expenses. Many policyholders may expect that their medical expenses will be fully covered as long as the total hospital charges do not exceed the specified annual policy limit. The Complaints Panel would like to remind policyholders of the R&C clause in the policy provisions which aims to eliminate potential abuse of overcharging of medical fees and to control costs for the overall benefit of the insuring public.","近年,越來越多人選擇購買為大部分 醫療費用提供「全數賠償」保障的額 外住院計劃,許多保單持有人或會以 為只要總住院費用沒有超出保單年度 的指定上限,他們的住院費用便可獲 得全數賠償。投訴委員會提醒保單持 有人,保單條文附有合理及慣常收費 條款,旨在剔除濫收醫療費用的潛在 風險及控制成本,從而維護投保大眾 的整體利益。"
